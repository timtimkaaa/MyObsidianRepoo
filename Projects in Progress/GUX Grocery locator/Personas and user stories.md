#### Frustrations & barriers (Warsaw context)

1. **Too many loyalty apps** → can’t remember which chain has which promo today.
2. **Hard-to-find products** → especially "novelty" section or ready-to-eat meals in crowded sections.
3. **Confusing layouts** → every Biedronka is different, so previous “mental map” doesn’t always work. 
4. **Out-of-stock surprises** → shows up for yogurt or bread and finds the shelf empty.
5. **Price uncertainty** → can’t always see clear per-unit pricing or compare similar items quickly.
6. **List chaos** → juggling paper notes, Messenger chats with himself, or screenshots of items he needs.
7. **Forgets something** → realizes after checkout that he missed an essential (e.g., butter).
8. **Wasted time** → hates doubling back across the store because he missed an aisle.
9. **Impulse temptations** → grabs extra snacks when stressed, regrets overspending later.
