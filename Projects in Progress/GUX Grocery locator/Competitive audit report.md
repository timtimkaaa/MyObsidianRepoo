### 1. Competitive Audit Goal(s)

Compare the **in-store grocery collection and list management experience** of each competitor’s app as a **new user** and a **returning user**.

### 2. Who Are Your Key Competitors? (Description)

My client is **Auchan**, a multinational supermarket chain with a digital app that extends the in-store experience, and **Listonic**, a grocery list app designed for digital shoppers who want to organize and streamline their shopping experience.

- **Auchan**. as our client, already has some functionality, offering an integrated retail app (“Scan & Go”) that connects digital shopping lists with in-store checkout and product scanning.  
- **Listonic** is an **indirect competitor**, focusing purely on digital list-making and household organization without ties to a retail network.

### 3. What Are the Type and Quality of Competitors’ Products? 

The **Auchan app** allows customers to create grocery lists, scan items in-store, and complete payment via self-checkout. Its strength lies in convenience and integration with Auchan’s retail ecosystem. 
The app is free, accessible, and practical, though the interface is basic and lacks strong personalization features. Visual design is clean but utilitarian.

The **Listonic app** focuses on digital shopping list creation and sharing. It’s well-designed, intuitive, and supports more than 40 languages, providing excellent accessibility. Users can sort items automatically, sync lists, and collaborate with family members. 
However, ads can interfere with the experience, and its design—though modern—lacks emotional engagement or strong brand differentiation.

### 4. How Do Competitors Position Themselves in the Market? 

**Auchan** positions itself as a **retail innovator**, bridging physical and digital grocery experiences. Its app primarily targets European customers who value convenience, affordability, and efficient in-store experiences. Auchan appeals to a **broad, cost-conscious audience**, leveraging its existing brand trust and store network.

**Listonic** positions itself as a **digital-first productivity tool** for everyday shoppers. It targets **tech-savvy, multilingual users and families** who plan groceries together and prioritize organization and budget management. It’s marketed globally as a smart, lightweight companion app for efficient shopping.

### 5. How Do Competitors Talk About Themselves? 

**Auchan** describes itself as a **trusted retailer** that combines **quality, comfort, and innovation**. Its messaging centers on convenience (“Scan & Go” as a time-saving feature) and affordability, reflecting its brand values of practicality and customer care.

**Listonic** describes itself as an app that helps users **save money and time** by keeping grocery lists smart, synchronized, and easy to manage. The tone is **neutral, practical, and efficiency-driven**, focusing on organization rather than brand storytelling.

### 6. Competitors’ Strengths 

**Auchan’s strengths include:**

- Seamless integration between app and in-store shopping (“Scan & Go”).
    
- High-contrast interface that supports accessibility.
    
- Simple, minimal navigation and clear information hierarchy.
    
- Trust and brand recognition as a large retail chain.


**Listonic’s strengths include:**

- Clean, intuitive interface optimized for quick list creation.
    
- Excellent accessibility (40+ languages supported).
    
- Smart features such as automatic sorting and cloud sync.
    
- Strong usability for both new and returning users.


### 7. Competitors’ Weaknesses 

**Auchan’s weaknesses include:**

- Limited personalization (no product recommendations or saved preferences).
    
- Plain, utilitarian visual design lacking emotional appeal.
    
- Inconsistent flow between “list” and “Scan & Go” functions.
    
- Few accessibility options beyond basic color contrast.


**Listonic’s weaknesses include:**

- Ad-supported model disrupts user experience.
    
- No integration with real in-store purchase data or retailers.
    
- Limited visual brand identity; feels generic.
    
- Overly detailed product content can overwhelm users.


### 8. Gaps 

Some gaps we identified include:

- Neither app provides **personalized recommendations** or remembers **past orders/favorites**.
    
- Both lack **rewards or loyalty programs** for returning users.
    
- Limited **connection between online list creation and in-store fulfillment**.
    
- Accessibility support focuses mainly on text and language rather than inclusive design (e.g., voice input).

### 9. Opportunities 

Some opportunities we identified include:

- Offer a **quick and easy way to reorder** previously purchased items.
    
- Introduce **personalized shopping suggestions** based on history and context.
    
- Develop a **loyalty or rewards system** to retain returning users.
    
- Strengthen **visual identity** to better express Auchan’s brand values.
    
- Expand **accessibility** with voice commands, assistive tech integration, and customizable interfaces.


---

### 10. Summary

Auchan’s app succeeds at blending digital tools with physical shopping but lacks the simplicity, accessibility, and emotional engagement found in Listonic. By **bridging personalization, brand design, and loyalty**, Auchan can position itself as a **unified, user-centered grocery companion** that outperforms both digital-only and in-store-only competitors.
