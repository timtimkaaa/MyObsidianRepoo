### Introduction

**Title:** Creating  in-store Grocery Locator app for an existing store (Auchan)
**Author:** Tsimafei Mardashou, UX student, tsimafeimardashou@gmail.com

- **Stakeholders:** Grocery Locator customers, recruiters: anywhere, viewers: anywhere.
- **Date:** 11/17/2025
- **Project background:** We’re creating a Grocery Locator app to help make grocery lists, check for sales and locate products in-store, so they can save time, money and frustration while shopping in store. Some patrons are frustrated with not finding some products in-store and end up spending more time in store or having to go to the store again.
- **Research goals:** Figure out if a store-tailored list-maker and locator save people time, money and frustration.

### Research questions

- How long does it take to go through the whole process of making a list and shopping for groceries using location functionality?
- What can we learn from the steps users take to buy groceries with a list, versus on the fly?
- What can we learn from the steps users take to buy groceries with a navigator, versus using in-store cues (traditionally)?

### Key performance indicators (KPIs)

- Time on task
- User error rates
- System Usability Scale
- Drop off rates (additional)

### Script

- Intro:
	- Before we begin, do I have your consent to take both audio and video recordings of this interview?
	- I want you to know that this isn’t a test. There is no “right” answer, and none of your responses will be considered wrong.
	- If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.
	- This data is being collected to help create an app that makes grocery shopping easier. Your answers will help us make the app easier for people to use.
- Basic questions:
	- Do you live close to any big grocery stores (like Auchan, Carrefour, Eurospar)?
	- Do you go there often and how often?
	- Do you usually go alone or with someone?
	- Can you talk me through your usual day, on which you go shopping?
	- Great! If you’re ready, let’s move on to the tasks you’ll be working on.
- Prompt 1: Open up the Grocery Locator app on your phone and try to locate a product.
	- Follow-up: How easy do you feel it is to locate a product.
