*Project:* GUX Grocery locator

<hr>


Design an app and a responsive website for a local grocery store that helps shoppers locate products as they shop in person. 

---

I chose it after long considerations, because I like to work with interactions that are close to people. Where they are talking to the app, not the numbers in it. Also I couldn't choose some of the options because they weren't suitable for my country and the way things work here.
