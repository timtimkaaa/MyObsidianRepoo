### Dmitryi

Dmitryi is a student on budget mostly shopping at small stores, who needs to quickly get all the items he needs in one place, because he doesn't want to return to the store or to go to a different one.

If Dmitryi uses Grocery Locator to make a grocery list and check for product availability (and prices?), then he will buy all the items needed quickly and in one go.
### Katarzyna

Katarzyna is a busy office worker using a wheelchair to get around, who needs to quickly buy the food for the week cooperating with her partner, because she has a tight schedule and little time for shopping.

If Katarzyna uses Grocery Locator to collaboratively edit grocery lists and navigate the store with her husband quicker, then she will spend less time and nerves on shopping for groceries.
