#### Goals & Jobs-to-be-Done

1. **“No wasted trips”** – Avoid showing up to empty shelves; wants **credible availability** hints.
2. **“Find it fast”** – Quickly locate specific items (e.g., oat milk, hummus, pasta sauce) in the aisles without wandering.
3. **“No wasted time”** – Reduce time spent searching, especially when shopping after work or late evening.
4. **“Plan smart”** – Make a short shopping list before leaving home, check it off while shopping, and see optimal path inside the store.
5. **“Choose better”** – Get help comparing similar products (nutrition, price per 100g, promos) to decide quickly.
6. **“Don’t forget staples”** – Be reminded of usual items (bread, milk, eggs) or low-stock at home before checkout.
7. **“Stay within budget”** – Track total basket cost in real time, avoid overspending on impulse buys.
#### Frustrations & barriers (Warsaw context)

1. **Too many loyalty apps** → can’t remember which chain has which promo today.
2. **Hard-to-find products** → especially "novelty" section or ready-to-eat meals in crowded sections.
3. **Confusing layouts** → every Biedronka is different, so previous “mental map” doesn’t always work. 
4. **Out-of-stock surprises** → shows up for yogurt or bread and finds the shelf empty.
5. **Price uncertainty** → can’t always see clear per-unit pricing or compare similar items quickly.
6. **List chaos** → juggling paper notes, Messenger chats with himself, or screenshots of items he needs.
7. **Forgets something** → realizes after checkout that he missed an essential (e.g., butter).
8. **Wasted time** → hates doubling back across the store because he missed an aisle.
9. **Impulse temptations** → grabs extra snacks when stressed, regrets overspending later.
