### Introduction

**Title:** Creating  in-store Grocery Locator app for an existing store (Auchan)
**Author:** Tsimafei Mardashou, UX student, tsimafeimardashou@gmail.com

- **Stakeholders:** Grocery Locator customers, recruiters: anywhere, viewers: anywhere.
- **Date:** 11/17/2025
- **Project background:** We’re creating a Grocery Locator app to help make grocery lists, check for sales and locate products in-store, so they can save time, money and frustration while shopping in store. Some patrons are frustrated with not finding some products in-store and end up spending more time in store or having to go to the store again.
- **Research goals:** Figure out if a store-tailored list-maker and locator save people time, money and frustration.

### Research questions

- How long does it take to go through the whole process of making a list and shopping for groceries using location functionality?
- What can we learn from the steps users take to buy groceries with a list, versus on the fly?
- What can we learn from the steps users take to buy groceries with a navigator, versus using in-store cues (traditionally)?

### Key performance indicators (KPIs)

- Time on task
- User error rates
- System Usability Scale
- Drop off rates (additional)

### Methodology

- Moderated usability study
- **Location:** Poland, *REMOTE???*
- **Date:** Session is going to take place on ...???
- Five participants complete making a list and "shop for products". Each participant completes a questionnaire on their experience privately.
- Each session will last 45 minutes and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire.

### Participants

- Participants are people who go shopping to medium-to-large stores at least once a week. They could usually go alone or ~={cyan}with someone=~.
- 2 male, 2 female, 1 - ???, all aged 18-50yo.
- 1 user of assistive technology
- Incentive: a big thank you.

### Script

- Intro:
	- Before we begin, do I have your consent to take both audio and video recordings of this interview?
	- I want you to know that this isn’t a test. There is no “right” answer, and none of your responses will be considered wrong.
	- If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.
	- This data is being collected to help create an app that makes grocery shopping easier. Your answers will help us make the app easier for people to use.
	- This is a simple prototype, so try to use your imagination to make it look more real to you.
- Basic questions:
	- Do you live close to any big grocery stores (like Auchan, Carrefour, Eurospar)?
	- Do you go there often and how often?
	- Do you usually go alone or with someone?
	- Can you talk me through your usual day, on which you go shopping?
	- Great! If you’re ready, let’s move on to the tasks you’ll be working on.
- Prompt 1: Imagine you're at a store and you're struggling to find a product. Let's say it's {product}. Now open up the Grocery Locator app on your phone and try to locate that {product}.
	- Follow-up: How easy do you feel it is to locate a product?
- Prompt 2: Now, let's take a different situation: you're making a grocery list before going shopping. Try to create one and fill it out.
	- Follow-up: Did you find anything confusing?
	- Follow-up: Was there any point where you expected something different from what had actually happened?
- Prompt 3: Now let's say you want to buy a product, but first you want to check if there are any sales for a particular brand of {product}.
	- Follow-up: What was your logic for searching for sales? Did it apply well to this app?
- Prompt 4: Now let's go back to that list you were making earlier and try to use it to navigate the store. What do you think it looks like?
	- Follow-up: Try it now, please.
	- Follow-up: Did your logic for navigation work well with the way it works here?
