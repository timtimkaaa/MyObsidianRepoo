## Overview

This project is concerned with reworking the Facebook's Events feature. The idea came from Vova (my neighbour), who's been frustrated with it for a long time. The Idea is to learn the ropes of working on a real feature as a UX designer, so that I could [[Practice should come before theory (sometimes)|use practice to later understand theory better|]].


## Expectations

- I expect to create a rough feature design, going through all the parts of a design sprint. 
- I also expect everything to go as wrong as it can. And I have no problem with that. 


## Challenges 

- I expect it to be very hard to start each part of the process, since it's my first time
- to have problems with deadlines
- it to be hard to wrap my head around the concepts and techniques I'll have to work with. 


## Goals

- I expect that I will learn a lot about the actual process of a design sprint and, more widely, design process in general
- to get a better understanding of what my job will look like
- to get some experience with tools and techniques used by a UX designer. 


## Plan

#### Day 1 – Understand & Map (Mon)

**Goal:** Define the challenge, map the user journey, and set a target.

- **Research & context gathering**
    
    - Briefly study Facebook’s Events feature (desktop + mobile).
        
    - Note pain points from personal use + quick chats with friends (what they like/dislike).
        
- **Define the problem statement**
    
    - Example: _“How might I make Facebook Events easier to discover, RSVP, and follow up on?”_
        
- **Map the flow**
    
    - Sketch the high-level journey: Discover event → RSVP → Share → Attend → Follow-up.
        
- **Pick a target**
    
    - Focus on **one part** (ex: “Discovering relevant events” or “Managing RSVP and reminders”).

#### Day 2 – Sketch (Tue)

**Goal:** Generate possible solutions.

- **Lightning Demos (inspiration):**
    
    - Look at competitors (Eventbrite, Meetup, Google Calendar).
        
- **Crazy 8s (solo version):**
    
    - Fold a sheet into 8 panels, sketch 8 variations in 8 minutes.
        
- **Solution sketch:**
    
    - Pick your favorite idea(s) and draw them out in detail, step by step.

#### Day 3 – Decide & Storyboard (Wed)

**Goal:** Narrow down to one concept to prototype.

- **Solo decision:**
    
    - Quickly review your sketches, pick the most feasible/impactful idea.
        
- **Storyboard:**
    
    - Make a 6–8 frame storyboard of the user flow (how someone interacts with your redesign).

#### Day 4 – Prototype (Thu)

**Goal:** Build a realistic but lightweight prototype.

- Use **Figma** or **Sketch** (keep it clickable, not pixel-perfect).
    
- Include only the critical screens from your storyboard.
    
- Make sure the prototype is testable in ~5 minutes.

#### Day 5 – Test (Fri)

**Goal:** Validate your idea with real users (your friends).

- Recruit **5 friends** (video call or in person).
    
- Give them small tasks (e.g., “Find a concert you’d like to go to and RSVP”).
    
- Watch how they interact—take notes on confusion points, hesitation, surprises.
    
- Ask follow-up questions after: _“What was frustrating? What worked well?”_

#### Optional Weekend Extension (Sat–Sun)

If you want to stretch to **7 days** instead of 5:

- **Sat – Synthesize insights**
    
    - Summarize patterns from testing.
        
    - What worked? What failed? What should change?
        
- **Sun – Polish & case study write-up**
    
    - Create your UX case study format:
        
        1. **Problem & context**
            
        2. **Process (with sketches & prototypes)**
            
        3. **Findings from testing**
            
        4. **Next steps / reflections**
