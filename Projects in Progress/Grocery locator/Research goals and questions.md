### Goals

1. I want to understand **common challenges** people face when trying to **fit buying groceries in their busy schedule**, and **shopping for groceries itself**.
2. I want to identify **frustrations** people experience during the process of **selecting and gathering groceries to buy**.

### Participant Characteristics

The ideal interview participants:
- Are aged **12-65**. // *It could be anyone but these are most likely to go shopping and use a phone
- Live in **metropolitan** or **suburban** areas // *Much more likely to go to an unknown store or have multiple stores
- **Cook** food at home at least **once a week** // *Much more likely to have many things on their list and need to go through the whole store
- Shop at a **bigger type of stores** at least **once a week** (not Biedronka)

Additionally they include people, who:
- Have **special** food preferences (e.g. vegans) // Good for diversity
- Have **disabilities**
- Have **different genders**
