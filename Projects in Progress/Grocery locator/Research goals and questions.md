### Goals

1. I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and include shopping, and shopping for groceries.
2. I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of picking and gathering groceries to buy.

### Participant Characteristics

The ideal interview participants:
- Are aged 12-65. // It could be anyone but these are most likely to go shopping and use a phone
- Live in **metropolitan** or **suburban** areas // Much more likely to go to an unknown store or have multiple stores
- Cook food at home at least once a week // Much more likely to have many things on their list and need to go through the whole store
- Shop at a bigger type of stores at least once a week(not Biedronka)
Additionally they include people, who:
- Have special food preferences (e.g. vegans) // Good for diversity
- Have disabilities
- Have different genders
