Recently I started working, and it brought a lot of changes. One of which is the fact that I can't spend hours hanging out with people.

Because of that I start to sacrifice my other activities, especially the ones connected to well-being, to spend more time with my friends.

How to fix it: 
1) [[If you get tired of the thing you like, you are doing it too much (to enjoy)|Fun should always have it's limits]]. And so it's better to hang out for 2 hours and really enjoy it, than to spenda whole day together and get tired of each other.
2) I feel [[FOMO]]. Which I shouldn't because my well-being activities are just as enjoyable. And they help me feel better in general in life.
3) There are some activities that I need to do with someone, and they are fine. But I have to make it so I only do them and not all the other stuff. Also I need to make sure I limit the time of this activity. Read 1)
