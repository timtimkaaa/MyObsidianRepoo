Two guys talking on the phone/walkie-talkie in nature. One of them is in a cold forest, the other is in warm grasslands (me).
I tell the first guy that I've been waiting for him for a month now and I'm really starting to get frustrated by it. He says he's trying but he just can't find the path I went on. I'm getting more and more upset. Stop talking to him. And in the end he says he thinks his path lies through the forest and he kinda likes it. I say that if it's his thing, then I guess we're going to have to go separate ways, but we can still talk. Then he finds an way underground. I tell him to keep me updated.*2025-06-02*
