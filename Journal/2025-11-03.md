Today was really good

I woke up at 7 and felt really lazy and couldn't even go wash myself. But it was nice laziness. I still worked a bit.

Then I went to an event to get some free flowers with Anya, which didn't happen because it was postponed because of the bad weather. But I liked the weather. Then we went to get some coffee, but actually ended up wandering in search for a pumpkin pie I wanted. We did find a pumpkin cake in the end, and I was really delighted eating it later. Of course most of it was the adventure it took to get it, not the cake itself. 

Also I bought a pumpkin on my way home... I don't even know what exactly I'm going to do with it, but I definitely don't regret buying it.

Then after I ate lunch I kept studying till the very end of the day. That was really nice, even though tough at moments. I feel really fulfilled today. 

I wonder, what brought this feeling. Here are the options anyway: I went swimming yesterday, I went outside before 2pm, I had a veeery active weekend both mentally and physically, I didn't overeat and after all I did work a lot.
