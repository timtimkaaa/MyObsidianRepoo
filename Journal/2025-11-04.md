#journaling 

Today was ok. Just a normal day.

I woke up at7, but decided to sleep till 7:30 because I overdrank tea yesterday.

Then I woke up pretty quickly, and made quinoa for breakfast. I've finally found that quinoa from my childhood that I liked so much.

Then I walked with Vova to the park and worked there. I got to pet a dog and watch quackers do the quackin. Then I headed home to pee. 

From there I went to meet with Ilya and we hung out for a bit going to Arkadia and then walking all around the city. Literally from Arkadia to Praga.


The I went home to continue working. But first dinner. I enjoyed quite a bit and then went back to work. I worked for about three more hours and then called it a day. 

I feel tired and a bit emptied, but also somewhat fulfilled since I've worked all day, but still feel like I could do more. Which again **if I didn't feel like working full force, I likely needed to take it easy and did so**.

Besides that I also feel sleepy and dreamy, which is a sign of me working well and getting enough sun.
