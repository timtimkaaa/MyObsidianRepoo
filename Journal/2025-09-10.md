- TodayI performed my mourning routine almost well, but took too much time to get out of bed. 
- Apparently Auchan doesn't have any variety in non-dairy milk, so I had to go to Biedronka to get it.
- Also I had a bit of an angry moment In the afternoon when I realized that besides firing me (yup that's before I started journaling), my company also needed me to print out a sticker to put on the package with their equipment. 
-  After all that I got to studying, which was interrupted a lot. 
	- Vova told me about his Excel business analytics course and projects and I told him about my achievements. 
	- Also Ulyana called and we talked for a bit. She's still really upset with Artemiy (he's had a bad breakdown). But he is getting better already, so soon we'll be back to good old too much romance while I'm around.
- After that I called my parents and told them how I got fired, and they comforted me, which was nice.
- Then I finished the day with 5,5hrs of work today, which is not bad
- Just 10 minutes ago I saw an email that said I was approved to work for Data Annotation. We'll see how this goes.
