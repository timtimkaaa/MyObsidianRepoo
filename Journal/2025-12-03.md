#journaling 

Negative thought chains:

I matched a girl on bumble and she has to write a message first -> 
what if I won't like her -> 
that's why you chat before meeting -> 
**well she isn't going to answer anyways** -> **why not just see notifications😡** -> 
(maybe they're turned off) why not just turn them on -> 
some people are such assholes

I used a very **pessimistic perspective** for no reason and got frustrated with this imagined scenario. So I tried to find a reason to be upset with them.
