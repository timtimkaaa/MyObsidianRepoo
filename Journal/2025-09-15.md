Today was really nice. I feel super sleepy right now. 

I talked with Vova while doing my morning routine and went swimming. It was hard to swim today, but I also swam 20 lapses in less than 30 minutes. 

Then I went outside to study. I LOVED it. I've never realized just how cool Sad Krasi≈Ñskich is. We also talked with Ulyana there which took a bit of time from my work, but also it was good, even if a bit too long. 

I headed home and worked here for 3 more hours, I also talked to my parents while at it. 

Then I talked to Ulyana some more and actually learned some polish by watching a polish show together.

Now I'm trying not to fall asleep right now, so that means it was a good day. I've worked, studied, socialized, worked out and went outside - perfect combo.
