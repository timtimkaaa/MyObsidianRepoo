#journaling 

I've been working and listening to music while at it and it sent me thinking...

I got happy flashbacks from the past, and I felt how beautiful life is. I also realized just how unnecessary those negative emotions I've been using to "defend myself" really are. I felt sort of a touch with true happiness and realized how futile all those ужимки are in face of true happiness. 

I have to not forget this experience and remember it when I feel all those negative emotions take over.

Also it so happens thatI got this feeling after making music and being with a friend and consistently leading a very healthy lifestyle. Next step is obviously make media take up less of my life.
