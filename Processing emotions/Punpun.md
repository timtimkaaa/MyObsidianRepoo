I feel him because I was also awkward with girls and I was experiencing similar emotions (anxiety, depressive thoughts, self hate and blaming it on others). And while I was able to get out of it and feel good after all, watching a different person be in a similar place and make such different conclusions and actions makes me feel really bad. But why?

Am I afraid of becoming the same? A little bit, because I'm still the same person as me 5 years ago and I can still relate to the main character even if I know how bad these tendencies are. 

I think at this moment I should also acknowledge that even though I'm similar to him, I'm an adult and I know what these tendencies can do and I know a better way to go about it. So even if I'm similar to punpun and his uncle in some ways. I'm different in others - especially in the fact that I know how bad their thoughts and actions are. And by bad I mean bad for themselves and others around them.
