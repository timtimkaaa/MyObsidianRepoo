I want to start a new way of journaling today. It will fulfill 2 goals at once. I will do art every day and journal every day. These things reinforce each other when put together.

Here I want to map out the plan of a typical note to introduce constraints for more productivity and less thinking "what should I do".

Here's the current plan (and previous ones if I get to them):

1. Day's recap with doodles and stuff
2. Gratefulness with doodles and stuff
3. Drawing of the day
4. What I've learned and what vibe/energy I had today
5. Give the note a name
