Ideas overall:

- - Things like social media help with ADHD
###  + All points to cover

- Social media
	- Make you addicted (brain chemistry)
	- Tire you down (many emotions and a lot of dopamine at once)
	- Make you feel like you're relaxing
	- Make you FOMO (social comparison)
	- Normalize all of the above by being a way to connect people
- Health
	- Lower attention span (stat)
	- Rise of depression (all the emotions drained into many things at the same time)
	- We need to really relax our bodies and minds (and not by watching tiktok or an ad) - **Information overload**
	- It's natural to want non-stop entertainment - **that's how they get us**
	- Willpower comes from boredom
- Kids
	- All the above
	- There is a statistically significant difference in hours using social media during study periods, weekends, and holidays. For those who spent less than 2 h in the study, the prevalence of risk of ADHD was 21% and increased to 37.6% among those who spent > 4 h (_p_ < 0.001). The same observation was found among those who spent more hours on social media during weekends (34.8%) (_p_ = 0.001) and those who spent > 4 h during holidays (32.7%) (_p_ = 0.038) (Table [4](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-024-05988-6#Tab4)).
	- "Results showed support for reciprocal associations between digital media and ADHD symptoms, with associations being more consistent for problematic use of digital media than for screen time. Thus, children with ADHD symptoms appear more vulnerable to developing high or problematic use of digital media (i.e., selection effects), and digital media also have effects on later ADHD symptom levels, either because of specific characteristics of digital media or because of indirect effects on, for example, sleep and social relations (i.e., media effects)"
	- Parents give kids ipads - they think they're busy while actually watching tiktok themselves
	- Can you hear that ... silence, do you want your kids to never hear it

### - Conflict with freedom of speech

- When speaking you're actively using someone else's attention
- They can threaten to or actually sue you to stop you from expressing your opinion
- So anyone can threaten to sue after hearing an opinion they don't like
