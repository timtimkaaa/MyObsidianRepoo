Ideas overall:

- - Things like social media help with ADHD
###  + All points to cover

- Social media
	- Make you addicted (brain chemistry)
	- Tire you down (many emotions and a lot of dopamine at once)
	- Make you feel like you're relaxing
	- Make you FOMO (social comparison)
	- Normalize all of the above by being a way to connect people
- Health
	- Lower attention span (stat)
	- We need to really relax our bodies and minds (and not by watching tiktok or an ad) - **Information overload**
	- It's natural to want non-stop entertainment - **that's how they get us**
	
- Kids
	- All the above
	- There is a significant difference in hours using social media. For those who spent less than 2 h in the study, the prevalence of risk of ADHD was 21% and increased to 37.6% among those who spent > 4 h (_p_ < 0.001). The same observation was found among those who spent more hours on social media during weekends (34.8%) (_p_ = 0.001) and those who spent > 4 h during holidays (32.7%) (_p_ = 0.038) 
	- Children with ADHD symptoms appear more vulnerable to developing high or problematic use of digital media, and digital media also have effects on later ADHD symptom levels,
	- Parents give kids ipads - they think they're busy while actually watching tiktok themselves
	- Can you hear that ... silence, do you want your kids to never hear it
	- Creativity and motivation come from boredom
	- Freedom of thought away from you
### - Conflict with freedom of speech

- When speaking you're actively using someone else's attention
- They can threaten to or actually sue you to stop you from expressing your opinion
- So anyone can threaten to sue after hearing an opinion they don't like
