Ideas overall:

- - Things like social media help with ADHD
###  + All points to cover

- Social media
	- Make you addicted (brain chemistry)
	- Tire you down (many emotions and a lot of dopamine at once)
	- Make you feel like you're relaxing
	- Make you FOMO (social comparison)
	- Normalize all of the above by being a way to connect people
- Health
	- Rise of ADHD --- ***Stat***
	- Lower attention span (stat)
	- Rise of depression (all the emotions drained into many things at the same time)
	- We need to really relax our bodies and minds (and not by watching tiktok or an ad) - **Information overload**
	- It's natural to want non-stop entertainment - **that's how they get us**
	- Willpower comes from boredom
- Kids
	- All the above
	- Parents give kids ipads - they think they're busy while actually watching tiktok themselves
	- Can you hear that ... silence, do you want your kids to never hear it

### - Conflict with freedom of speech

- When speaking you're actively using someone else's attention
- They can threaten to or actually sue you to stop you from expressing your opinion
- So anyone can threaten to sue after hearing an opinion they don't like
