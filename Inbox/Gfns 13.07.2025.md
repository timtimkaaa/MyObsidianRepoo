This evening I'm grateful to:
1. The world and my parents for finally seeing them
2. Myself for really working hard and we'll to prepare for the journey
3. The world for having such a nice trip, especially with my parents
4. Myself for even finding time to go to the tea club today
5. Myself for having listened to my dad's album
