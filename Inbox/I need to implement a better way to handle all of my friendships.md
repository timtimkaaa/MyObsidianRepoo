All my life I've dreamed of having a lot of friends. And I have fulfilled that dream. I have a lot of people who I care for, and who care for me. And because I've never had a lot of friends, I've learned to cling on to any friendship I got and do anything to sustain it. 

But now, I have a lot of friends, and I know I don't have to cling on to a person just because they acknowledged me. So I have to find a mare efficient way to handle the amount of relationships I have. It might look mercantile and hypocritical, but I know for a fact it's not. I care about every single friend I have - they're my friends after all. But I can't be with all of them at the same time, nor can I handle them as it is right now. 

So I've come up with a way to sort people to see, who I want to give my limited time to.

There are 3 categories:
- Most important friendships - these are the people who I care for and value the most, and who I want to invest my time in the most.
- Potential important friendships - these are people, with who I sense that we fit each other and who I feel will get into the " most important friendships" category, but didn't yet.
- Other friends - importantly, still my friends, still people I enjoy and respect, but who don't feel as good to be around. All of them are valuable to me, and have all of my respect. They just don't fulfill enough of those specific needs I have at a given moment.

So here's the current list (and I'll try to update it once a month):
- **Most important friendships** 
	- Artemiy Gaidashou
	- Ulyana (Artem)
	- Dima Letova
	- Egor
	- Ilya
	- Artem Narkievich
	- Anton 
	- Stus
- **Potential important friendships**
	- Kirill
	- Makar
	- Fedya (Ania)
	- Ania (Fedya)
	- Luka
	- Katya (Anton)
	- Vova
	- 
- **Other friends**
