### Get comfortable

**~={yellow}Getting-to-know-you small talk=~** can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:

- How is your day going?
- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
- Do you have any favorite hobbies?

~={yellow}**Thank participants for coming**=~. Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

**Remind them to be ~={yellow}open and honest**=~ about their experience, so the design team can make improvements. To get the most useful feedback, let the participants know that you’re here to find out how to improve the design, so constructive criticism is more than welcome.

Finally, **make sure the ~={yellow}space=~ for usability testing is ~={yellow}physically comfortable=~**. Each type of space requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated.

- A **usability lab** is a place with equipment for conducting a usability study, like screen recorders, eye-tracking devices, and computers or mobile devices set up specifically for testing. 
- If you’re conducting the usability study in **someone’s home** or in a **public area**, find a place that's as clear of distractions as possible. 
- For usability studies conducted **online**, communicate whether you’re recording the participants or their screens, and let them know that the recordings will only be used for research related to your test.

### Put people first
 
 - Use pronouns and courtesy titles (mr, ms, mrs). 
 - When with an interpreter, always address the person, not the interpreter
 - Use **people-first language**, e.g. people with disability > disabled people
 - Don't forget about marginalized communities

### Don't skip the paperwork

 - Now you need to take care of some paperwork. Ask participants to sign a **~={yellow}nondisclosure agreement=~** (NDA), which informs participants that they can’t talk about your product or the usability study publicly. 
	 -  If the NDA is set up correctly, it helps build trust with participants and increase rapport.
 - Participants also need to sign paperwork to **~={yellow}allow their session to be recorded=~**. 
	 - You might record a usability study session through a paper note sheet, screen recorder, video recorder, or audio recorder. 
	 - Recording sessions makes it easier to turn observations into insights later, but participants will need to be aware of this process and provide consent.


### Communicate clearly

~={yellow}**Explain the focus of the study**=~ and what participants will give feedback on. Give the participant a roadmap or preview of what’s to come during the session. Be sure to ask the participant if the study you’ve explained will be okay with them before proceeding.

You’ll want to introduce the ~={yellow}**think-aloud method**=~, which is a type of data gathering that has participants turn their internal thoughts into shared ideas through spoken, signed, or typed words.
- When you use the think-aloud method, participants explain what they’re doing while they’re completing tasks. This gives you, as the researcher, an opportunity to record exactly what participants are thinking about a product, in addition to what you observe them doing during the study. 
- With this method, it’s crucial that participants know that they can be honest; they can’t offend you because their observations are helpful to improving the designs.

Also, **remind participants that ~={yellow}they are not being tested=~**. The goal is to understand how the user is experiencing your product, so **there’s no right or wrong answer!** If the participant can’t complete a task, that isn’t a reflection of their personal abilities; it’s a reflection of the design’s usability.

If you’re ever unsure about the feedback participants are sharing, try to **~={yellow}summarize their ideas for confirmation=~**. 
- Repeat back what you _think_ the participant means, and encourage them to correct or confirm the statement.
