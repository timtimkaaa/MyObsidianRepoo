### Get comfortable

**~={yellow}Getting-to-know-you small talk=~** can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:

- How is your day going?
- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
- Do you have any favorite hobbies?

~={yellow}**Thank participants for coming**=~. Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

**Remind them to be ~={yellow}open and honest**=~ about their experience, so the design team can make improvements. To get the most useful feedback, let the participants know that you’re here to find out how to improve the design, so constructive criticism is more than welcome.

Finally, **make sure the ~={yellow}space=~ for usability testing is ~={yellow}physically comfortable=~**. Each type of space requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated.

- A **usability lab** is a place with equipment for conducting a usability study, like screen recorders, eye-tracking devices, and computers or mobile devices set up specifically for testing. 
- If you’re conducting the usability study in **someone’s home** or in a **public area**, find a place that's as clear of distractions as possible. 
- For usability studies conducted **online**, communicate whether you’re recording the participants or their screens, and let them know that the recordings will only be used for research related to your test.
