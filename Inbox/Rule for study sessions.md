I've already established that the most optimal way for me to study is 3,5hr long sessions that go 
- 1hr studying
- 15min break
- 1hr studying
- 15min break
- 1hr studying.

3. At the end of the session I spend 5-10 minutes analyzing and recording my achievements.
4. I can only do the assigned task(s), meditate or exercise during the active parts of the session.
