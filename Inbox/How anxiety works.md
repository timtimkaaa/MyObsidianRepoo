Say you're a rabbit eating grass next to your home. All of a sudden you hear a noise, what do you do? It's not the right time to be relaxing, or to think of you really heard it or not. 

> You can skip lunch many times, but you can be lunch only once.

Our brains are designed by evolution to focus on and remember the things that are negative, threatening and blocking us. This is why we need to train them to pay attention to the whole picture and recognize that sometimes we ignore or tune out the positive, helpful things.

Once we become anxious, our minds tends to stay in or return to anxious moments to look for confirmation of expected impending danger. They do this in many ways. For example:
- **Intrusive thoughts**. Threat-detection system producing thoughts and images that just appear, even in seemingly calm situations. We might not get, why they appear.
- This is why relying on rationality sometimes doesn't work.

In cognitive therapy people compare evidence for and against our negative thoughts, and finding truth of our thinking. But sometimes it doesn't work:

Imagine you're on the 6th floor of a burning building. Your anxiety is telling you that if you fall - you'll die. This is perfectly correct and true, but not a good thing to think of. Instead you should be thinking about ways of getting down.
