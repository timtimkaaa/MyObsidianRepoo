### Example

<hr>
> [!example] Example of a Research plan
> ### Introduction 
> **Title:** Creating CoffeeHouse ordering app 
> **Author:** Ali, UX researcher, ali@coffeehouse.design
> - **Stakeholders:** CoffeeHouse customers, Gael Esparza: CTO, Linda Yamamoto: VP of design 
> - **Date:** 12-14-2020 
> - **Project background:** We’re creating a CoffeeHouse app to help people place and pick up multiple CoffeeHouse orders together at once, so they can skip in-store lines and the payment process is streamlined. Some patrons place orders for groups, and ordering individually takes too long. 
> - **Research goals:** Figure out if collaborative ordering in the app actually saves people time when placing group orders. 
> ### Research questions
> - How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 
> - What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?
> ### Methodology
> - Unmoderated usability study. 
> - **Location:** United States, remote (participants will go through the usability study in their own homes).
> - **Date:** Sessions will take place on February 8 and 9.
> - Five participants complete the collaborative ordering tasks on their own. One of the participants is randomly chosen to submit the group order. Each participant completes a questionnaire on their experience privately. 
> - Each session will last 45 minutes and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire. 
> ### Participants
> - Participants are people who place group coffee orders at least twice a month, whether as a business task or a social task. These orders could be for office meetings, friend groups, or family gatherings. 
> - Participants don’t have to be coffee drinkers themselves
> - 2 male, 2 female, 1 non-binary, all aged 20–75 years old
> - 1 user of assistive technologies (keyboard, screen reader)
> - Incentive: $10 CoffeeHouse gift card redeemable at any location or online

Now that you’ve reviewed the example, it’s time to assess how it works.

## UX research study plan template

First, notice how the example ~={yellow}follows the UX research study plan template=~. Templates help designers ensure their research plans are complete, readable, and visually appealing. These features are especially helpful when you have to align a team on a plan or get approval from stakeholders.

#### Intro

Next, notice that the plan’s introduction includes six key elements:

- Title
- Author
- Stakeholders
- Date
- Project background
- Research goals

For anyone who engages with the research plan, ~={yellow}these four details are crucial reminders of the project’s purpose, stakeholders, and timeframe=~. In the example, notice how:

- The **title** clearly indicates the focus and purpose of the study. The focus is the CoffeeHouse app. The purpose is creating the app and not, for example, updating or testing an existing app.
- The **author** section includes the researcher’s name, title, and email address. This contact information makes communicating about the plan more efficient.
- The **stakeholders** section indicates the people who are involved in the research and their roles. In this case, it’s the group targeted for testing and the company employees who oversee app changes and operations (including their names and titles).
- The **date** indicates when the plan was last updated, not when it was first created. Always remember to update the date every time you edit a research plan so you (and any teammates) know whether the plan is current.

#### Project background and research goals

In the example, notice how the ~={cyan}project background=~ offers a brief explanation of ~={yellow}**why** the CoffeeHouse app is being **created**=~ and ~={yellow}**what** is being **tested** with users=~. It’s not long and detailed, but rather efficient and precise. 

As the example shows, a ~={cyan}project background=~ ~={yellow}**should offer**=~ a brief explanation of ~={yellow}why you’re doing the research=~. It gets the team aligned at the beginning of the study and shows you understand the reason for the research. Also, for people who can act on your research and recommendations, a well-crafted project background promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights. 

Next, notice how the ~={cyan}research goals=~ indicate ~={yellow}what the researchers want to learn=~ from testing the CoffeeHouse app and ~={yellow}how the research results might affect their design decisions=~. They want to know whether collaborative ordering saves time.

~={cyan}Research goals=~ should clarify the ~={yellow}**specific ideas you want to learn**=~ from the research or the **~={yellow}outcomes you want to achieve=~**. As you craft research goals, think about questions like these: 

- What design problems am I trying to solve for the user and/or the business? 
- How will the results of the research impact our design decisions?

#### The research questions

Finally, consider the example’s **research questions**. These research questions are not the interview questions that researchers will pose to study participants. Instead, they state at a high level what the UX research is trying to answer:

- How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 
- What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?

These questions are effective because they showcase these four features:

**Actionable:** Actionable means each question clearly indicates the kind of answer being sought. With actionable questions, researchers will know when they have or have not found an answer. With the second question, for example, researchers know they are seeking information about the steps users are taking to make orders individually and in a group.

**Specific:** Specific questions produce meaningful data. In the first question, for example, notice the specific detail that researchers seek: length of time for a collaborative order made by a group of 4–5 people.

**Neutral:** To be neutral, research questions should be phrased so that they don’t sound like you’re assuming a particular answer to the question. They shouldn’t show bias or lead toward predetermined answers. For example, imagine if the first question were rewritten this way: “Why does it take groups so long to place collaborative orders?” This question is biased and leading: It assumes that collaborative orders take a long time rather than neutrally seeking information about how long the orders take.

**Methodological:** Methodological means the questions indicate whether they must be answered through **quantitative or qualitative** methods. The first question seeks quantitative information about length of time, information that can be measured numerically. The second question seeks qualitative information about users’ experiences. It offers opportunities to learn users’ feelings and other insights that are hard to capture numerically.


#### Questions to assess your research plans

When you start a research plan for your work, consider comparing the example above to your own introduction and research questions. 

As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use: 

Have you constructed a UX research study plan **introduction** that:

- Has a title that represents the focus and purpose of the study?
- Lists the name, title, and email address for the author of the plan?  
- Identifies the study’s stakeholders, including any groups targeted for testing and people at the company whose work might be affected by the study? 
- Has the date that the plan was last updated?
- Includes a brief explanation of the project background that communicates both the reason for the study and the concept being tested?
- Outlines research goals that demonstrate what you’d like to learn from the study and how your research results might affect your design decisions?
    

Based on your project’s problem statement, were you able to write **research questions** that are:

- Actionable and clearly answerable by your research? 
- Specific, to make sure your study produces meaningful data?
- Neutrally phrased and not leading, so users aren’t guided toward providing certain answers?
- Clear on whether quantitative or qualitative data is being collected?

### Methodology and participants

A good **methodology** will list:

- The procedures you’ll use while collecting the information you need to answer your research questions 
- The time and location of product tests and interviews
- Who will conduct the tests
- How the tests will be conducted

More exactly a good methodology should include:

- The type of study, like an unmoderated usability study, which means participants go through the instructions, tasks, and questions on their own without a moderator.
- The location of the study, like the United States (remote), which means U.S. participants will go through the usability study in their own homes.
- The specific dates when the study will take place. As shown in the example, sessions will take place on February 8 and 9. 
- The number of participants included in the study. For example, five participants are responsible for completing the collaborative ordering tasks on their own; one of the participants is randomly chosen to submit the group order; and each participant is responsible for completing a questionnaire on their experience privately. 
- A short description of the study session. As shown in the example, each session will last 45 minutes and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire.



The **participants** section of your UX research study plan should include:

- The primary characteristics of ideal participants, like their age, gender, race, accessibility needs, and in the case of the example, coffee preferences
- An incentive for people to participate, like a $10 CoffeeHouse gift card to any physical or online store.
- A means to thank the participants for their time, like a short thank-you message
