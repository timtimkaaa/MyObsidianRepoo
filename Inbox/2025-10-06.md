It's been just a normal day and I couldn't need anything more than that. 

I woke up and did everything pretty quickly until I saw vova with his new car wheel gamepad and played it for a bit. 

Then I went swimming and swam pretty well. I'm starting to learn to just go without taking breaks.

Then I studied, but not for a long time. I finished a module though!

Then I FINALLY got to watch Twin Peaks with Artemiy and Ulyana. It was very nice. I've seen even more details and just as before, I just loved the slow speed at which it goes. 

After I read the Book of lost things in Polish and trained some polish Anki. 

At the end of the day I meditated for 17min. It's not a lot, but still something.

Now I'm preparing to go to sleep and I feel pretty satisfied with today even though I had all the troubles. And further more I think I feel pretty ready for tomorrow.
