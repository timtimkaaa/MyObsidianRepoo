## Why do it
### What ~={cyan}competitive audits=~ ~={yellow}consist=~ of:

- Identifying your key competitors
- Reviewing the products that your competitors offer
- Understanding how your competitors position themselves
- in the market
- Examining what your competition does well and what they
- could do better
- Considering how your competitors talk about themselves

### ~={cyan}Competitive audits=~ can offer many ~={yellow}benefits=~ throughout your ideation phase, including:

- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
- Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
- Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
- Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
- Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.

### ~={yellow}Limitations=~ of ~={cyan}competitive audits=~:
- Stifle creativity
- Depend on how well you interpret the findings
- Not all designs work in all use cases
- Need to be done regularly

## How to do it

 >[!example] ~={cyan}*E.g.* =~
 *For the example in this reading, imagine you’re conducting competitive research on fast-food pizza restaurants for your new client, Pizza Garden. Pizza Garden feels that their current website isn’t attracting much business, and they want you to help the company redesign their website.*
 **Check exemplary finished table below**
### Step 1. Outline the audit ~={yellow}goals=~

Before you move into the details of the audit, you have to define your goals. Since the project is for a website redesign, the goal of the competitive audit is to compare the user experience of each competitor’s website.

![[gVt63MRcTk6betzEXF5OVA_88e03f518aa3461293a897fd880ca1e8_Competitive-audit_goal-1.png]]
Using consistent language for rating competitor products can also create more uniform feedback and help you “grade” competitors. You can grade competitors on a scale of:
1. **Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren’t getting what they need from this aspect of the app.
2. **Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.
3. **Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn’t always provide users with the necessary information easily.
4. **Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user’s needs.

### Step 2. ~={yellow}List=~ competitors

Start to build the competitor audit using the template. First, ask the company or team ~={yellow}who they consider to be their ~={cyan}direct and indirect=~ competitors=~. As a reminder: 
- **Direct competitors** have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. 
- **Indirect competitors** either have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience. 
Getting this information early can provide good insight into where the company really fits into their industry.

>[!example] **For example**, 
>Pizza Garden mentioned that ~={cyan}Pie Eaters=~ restaurant is one of their ~={yellow}direct competitors=~, so they should be included on the list. 
>
>Based on ~={yellow}your own research=~, you find two more ~={yellow}direct competitors=~ that are **also pizza restaurants** in the **same geographical area** as Pizza Garden, called ~={cyan}Pizza Nest=~ and The ~={cyan}Spotty Pie=~. 
>
>You also come across an ~={yellow}indirect competitor=~, ~={cyan}The Vegan Oven=~, that has an **international presence** and really **appealing imagery on their website**. The competitor audit spreadsheet now includes the information shown below.*

## Step 3. Determine the specific competitor aspects you want to compare

Defining a list of aspects you want to compare makes it easier to compile your results for analysis later on in the process.

> [!example] For this example, imagine that you check out each of the competitors’ websites and rate them based on the following categories:
> - **~={yellow}First impressions:=~** Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions. 
> 	- Is the website ~={cyan}responsive=~, meaning that it resizes across devices? 
> 	- Does the **design** ~={cyan}complement=~ the **product**? 
> 	- How do you ~={cyan}feel=~ about the website?
>- **~={yellow}Interaction:=~** Explore the **user flow** and **navigation** of the website. 
>	- What ~={cyan}features=~ are available for users? 
>	- Is the website ~={cyan}accessible=~ to all users, including those using **screen readers**? 
>	- How ~={cyan}inclusive=~ is their website to non-English speakers? 
>	- Will the user get ~={cyan}confused=~ as they click through the website pages, or is the ~={cyan}navigation clear=~? 
>- **~={yellow}Visual design:=~** Review competitor **branding** and their **overall consistency**. 
>	- Does the website **appear** and **feel** ~={cyan}the same=~ throughout all sections and pages? 
>	- Does the branding ~={cyan}match=~ the intended audience? 
>	- Is the imagery and color palette ~={cyan}memorable=~? 
>- **~={yellow}Content:=~** Examine the **written content** included on the website. 
>	- Does the tone of the content ~={cyan}match=~ the company’s branding? 
>	- Will users be ~={cyan}able to find=~ the details they’re interested in?

### Step 4. Research each company

Now that the ~={cyan}list of competitors=~ and ~={cyan}features=~ to compare is ~={yellow}filled in=~, it’s time to ~={yellow}check out each=~ of Pizza Garden’s competitors and ~={yellow}start the audit=~. 
If you were conducting **your own audit**, you would fill out the spreadsheet **row-by-row** as you review each competitor. You can include notes in bullet point form, links, and screenshots—whatever is most helpful for your information gathering process! 

#### Audience

> [!example] In our example
> ~={yellow}Millennials, including families=~, make up the **biggest portion** of the competitors’ **audiences**. 
> here’s also a small crossover between ~={yellow}millennials=~ and ~={yellow}Gen-Z college students=~. This is very **similar** to the audience that ~={cyan}Pizza Garden=~ is targeting. 
> 
> Only one competitor, ~={cyan}The Vegan Oven=~, has a **different audience**. That’s okay! ~={cyan}The Vegan Oven=~ wasn’t included as a direct competitor because their **audience isn’t similar** to ~={cyan}Pizza Garden’s=~. 
> 
> It’s still important to compare their website and overall user experience to ensure you’re getting a good sense of the entire market.
#### And so on 

##### *First impressions*

*The websites that make the best first impression are The Spotty Pie and The Vegan Oven. Both provide appealing and clear imagery and are fully responsive websites. On the other end, the websites for Pie Eaters and Pizza Nest weren’t very impressive. While they’re easy to navigate, they both need to work on improving their layouts.*

*For the mobile website experience, only one site had issues with responsiveness: Pie Eaters. Their website didn’t adjust to the smaller screen size of a mobile phone, so the spacing was misaligned and some information was cut off.* 

*For the sites with lower ratings, the biggest issue was the menu. Sometimes the menu wasn’t accessible, and other times the menu was included as an image that was hard to read. That’s definitely something to make note of for your redesign of the Pizza Garden website!*

##### *Interaction*

*The next part of the competitive audit focuses on the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find what they’re searching for on the website. Your client, Pizza Garden, needs help to create a hierarchy for their site that’s easier for users to follow and interact with.* 

*The Spotty Pie’s website includes animations that slow the navigation, and The Pizza Nest’s site has lots of unnecessary content on the homepage, which makes it hard to find important information like their phone number and menu. On the other end of the spectrum, the websites that work well have a clear navigation style and make it obvious which elements are clickable and which aren’t—a characteristic that’s important to include in the redesign of Pizza Garden’s website. The Vegan Oven is the standout competitor in the category with useful features like a store locator and comprehensive accessibility considerations including multiple language options and compatibility with screen reader technologies.*

##### *Visual design*

*A website with clear and consistent visual design is a great way to draw users into a product and company. Pizza Garden’s current website has pretty solid visual design overall, but there are a few areas that could be updated to better reflect their brand tone.* 

*The Spotty Pie and The Vegan Oven communicate their brand well with distinct colors, typography, and photography. But Pizza Nest and Pie Eaters both have an inconsistent visual style on their websites, and Pizza Nest’s site doesn’t communicate their brand very well.* 

*![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Wl9YlUVESEeiavo4D5Z5ZA_42d6850a345a48a7a7f49952de810ff1_Screenshot-2024-02-13-5.51.53-PM.png?expiry=1760572800000&hmac=UaaC2enpKZZnaWDm25g-4m6XljyNWuzzqv8Bh0zJ_Z0)*

##### *Content*

*The tone of the content is another way to communicate a company’s brand and engage users. Most of Pizza Garden’s competitors use an engaging and fun tone that fits their audiences. Pizza Garden’s tone is a little inconsistent and not as light-hearted as its competitors. This is an area for improvement when you redesign their website!* 

*In general, the competitors’ content is short and easy to follow. Pizza Garden’s current website descriptions come off as a bit dry and overly long, so you can point to competitors’ content as an example to follow.*

###  Step 5. Summarize your findings in a report

After conducting research, gathering data, and analyzing your findings, ~={yellow}summarize=~ your work in a ~={cyan}report=~. 

~={yellow}What=~ you include in your report and ~={yellow}how=~ you present your findings **will vary depending** on the ~={cyan}audit goals=~ you outlined at the beginning of the process. 

~={cyan}*For example=~
- *if your audit mainly focuses on comparing competitors’ audiences ➜ you might want to include a few informational graphics with numbers and figures.* 
- *Or, if your audit mainly focuses on visual design ➜ you might want to include screenshots of your competitors’ websites with different areas highlighted.*
