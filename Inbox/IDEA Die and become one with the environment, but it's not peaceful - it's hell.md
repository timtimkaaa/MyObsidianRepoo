Say, someone kills a character and leaves them in the woods. This way they become one with the woods. But the creature is part/ruler of the woods, and thus the character doesn't peacefully become one with nature, but feeds into the environment that killed them. Maybe they become a vengeful spirit or their soul becomes part of the forest and haunts the people who come.
