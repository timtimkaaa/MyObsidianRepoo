Lately I've been noticing that all of my friends are interested in understanding how the world around them works, and even though I like that too, I always get to a point where I don't feel like it's worth it anymore. Whenever it gets too hard is when I give up. 

The only thing that I didn't give up on are people. And I think I have an answer for that.

I think that the difference between discovering people vs technology/science is that I don't need to create people. Let me explain.

Usually whenever I'm learning about some new thing, it really fascinates me, until it comes to creating something myself without any guides or thought out scenarios. I'm sure there's a reason for that, but anyways. The difference with people is that I don't ever need to make them. They're just there and I can interact with them however I want. I don't care that much for the inner workings of their brains, I just care about their thoughts, feelings and personalities - a kind of a surface level. And this level is infinite and never gets boring.

So I enjoy studying and working on people over mechanisms/nature, because I don't need to create people - just discover them infinitely.
