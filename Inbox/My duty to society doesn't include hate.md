As I mentioned here: [[How I fulfill my duty to society]], I see it as my **societal duty** to ~={yellow}understand and love people=~. That's also one of the reasons I like art and I'm interested in UX.

Even so, sometimes I **hate** other people - ~={cyan}never the ones I know personally=~, just the ones someone else tells me about. I think it's ~={yellow}okay to feel angry or frustrated=~ about people and I shouldn't ignore these emotions. I should ~={yellow}let them go=~ and ~={yellow}not get too hung up=~ on them too.

I also need to **avoid other people triggering hatred in me**, as I am very good at understanding other people, so it's easy for me to get into their mindset. But ~={yellow}they are other people and it's their feeling, not mine. =~

Also I can feel like I **have to hate** someone, which is not true, because ~={yellow}I have a different way of helping the world - through love=~.
