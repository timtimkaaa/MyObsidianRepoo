To start, you need to do some research in order to answer these two questions:

- **What does your product do?** Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users. 
- **Why should the user care?** Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.

**Step 1. Describe your product’s features and benefits.** Create a list of all the great features and benefits of your product, big and small. Don’t hold back; list everything that comes to mind and then narrow it down later.

**Step 2. Explain the value of the product.** Anything that you identify as a value proposition needs to be beneficial to your users. *E.g., for the dog walker app, there were four categories of product values that were identified during user interviews: accessible, professional experience of the dog walkers, cost, and reliability. The giant list of features and benefits from step one is sorted into those four categories.*

**Step 3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users.** The goal is to identify what’s truly valuable to the user and not just a cool feature that users didn’t ask for. To determine value, take the personas you’ve developed and pair each persona with a value proposition that meets their biggest pain point.

**Step 4. Review your official value proposition list.** You’ve narrowed your list down of lots of benefits and features by matching them with actual user needs. Now it’s time to review the list of value propositions your product offers. Compare it to the ones competitors have and lack (read reviews).
