#### Problem statement need to be:
- Human-centered
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough to be solved by a design

#### Problem statement help:
- Establish goals
- Understand constraints
- Define deliverables
- Create benchmarks for success (e.g. goal: to open the door => benchmark: see what's behind the door)

After you define the user’s [[Pain points|pain points]], you can ... 


### Answer the ~={yellow}5W's and H=~ to answer the user’s problem

~={yellow}**Who**=~ is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.

~={yellow}**What**=~ are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.

**~={yellow}Where=~** is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.

~={yellow}**When**=~ does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 

~={yellow}**Why**=~ is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.

~={yellow}**How**=~ are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

*~={cyan}E.g.=~ Arnold, who needs to find a dog walker, but is afraid to admit he's not as tech savvy*
 
- ***Who:** A busy executive*
- ***What:** Arnold wants to hire a daily dog walker for his three dogs.*
- ***Where:** Arnold is likely using the app at work, on the go.* 
- ***When:** Arnold gets frustrated when he opens the app, starting from the very beginning of the user journey.* 
- ***Why:** Arnold doesn’t have a lot of experience with phone apps or similar technology.* 
- ***How:** Arnold wants to go easily from the home screen of the app to the list of dog walkers to the confirmation screen.*


Here are a few alternative design problem statement example formats:

- From the ~={cyan}point of view=~ of the user: “**~={yellow}I am=~** (persona) ~={yellow}**trying to**=~ (verb) ~={yellow}**but**=~ (barrier) ~={yellow}**because**=~ (cause) ~={yellow}**which makes me feel**=~ (emotional reaction)**.**”
	- *e.g., “I am a new mum trying to take care of my baby in the best way possible, but I don’t know if I’m doing a good job because I’m always at home alone and don’t have anyone to talk to about it, which makes me feel isolated and alone.”*
- Drawn from user research: “(Persona) ~={yellow}**needs a way to**=~ (user’s need) ~={yellow}**because**=~ (insight)**.**”
    - *e.g., “New mums need a way to connect with other mums because they are often at home alone during the day and feel isolated and alone.”*
- Using the 4 Ws: “**~={yellow}Our=~** (who) ~={yellow}**has the problem that**=~ (what) ~={yellow}**when**=~ (where)**. ~={yellow}Our solution should deliver=~** (why)**.**”
    - *e.g., “Our new mum has the problem that she has no one to talk to about the best way to care for her baby when she is at home alone every day. Our solution should deliver a way for her to feel connected to other mums so she feels less isolated and alone.”*

### Every Good Problem Framing Phase, No Matter How Simple, Should:

- **Avoid proposing solutions.** It’s easy to think in the tangible terms of features and functionality, but these will only distract from first understanding the fundamental problem.
- **Ask why.** It’s a simple question to help find insights under the surface. But as Fast Company contributor Tina Seelig [writes](https://www.fastcompany.com/1672354/how-reframing-a-problem-unlocks-innovation), asking “why” lets you see a situation from a different angle.
- **Reflect.** Make time to step back and look for connections and patterns. This is where insights lie that can set a product apart from competitors.
- **Keep it universal.** Avoid using jargon or any unnecessary complexities. The problem should be simple for anyone to understand, and ideally, to retell. Equipping team members to easily talk about what you are trying to achieve will build confidence and passion within the project.
