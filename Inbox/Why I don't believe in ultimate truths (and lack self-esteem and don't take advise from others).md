I really don't like it when people say ultimate truths, and it comes from my childhood. It's also a reason why I still have **low self-esteem** and always **need to get a confirmation from others**, aaand **have a hard time taking other people's advice**

In my childhood I was taught that there are *"ultimate truths"*, so then for a very long time **I've been listening** to dozens of people tell me their *"ultimate truths"* about **how the world works**, about **who they are**, and about **who I am.** 

Since I also learned in childhood that **arguing against someone's opinions is bad**, I always took other people's truths at face value and never developed one of my own (because people said theirs was the right one).

This way, I didn't develop any defence mechanisms for situations, when people treated me unfairly - they clearly said they were the right ones after all. 

Thanks to my family and friends, and of course me, I'm much better now. I now know how to stand up for my points and ideas, and not blindly trust others
