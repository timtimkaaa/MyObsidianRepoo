I've noticed that there are two very distinctive types of joy I experience.

1. Pleasure - greedy type of enjoyment that makes you do something (sometimes negative) to get it. It's like being addicted to drugs - you can willfully do harmful things just to get a hit. 
2. Real happiness doesn't make you do anything, as there aren't any quick triggers for it. It only comes and goes, while the only way to influence it is working for the long run to make it come more frequently.
