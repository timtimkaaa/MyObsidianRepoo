A lot of times in my life I've tried to make the *right* choices and met with the same barrier. That barrier was the fact, that those choices required me to give up something I had and move on to something I didn't have yet. 

*For example*, my goal to become a musician by the time I finish university implied that I had to give up on, or rather avoid, university and commit to a bare goal without any base in real life.

**~={yellow}Whenever I choose to avoid something, I'm limiting myself, as some part of me did choose the path I now want to avoid=~**. I'm only cutting a part of myself off and putting on another pair of shackles. Instead I should do my best to free myself of all limitations, one of which is **avoidance**.

**~={yellow}It's better to find something to commit to, that's already in my life, than to prioritize something unreachable by forsaking what already have and value=~**.

Also there's another thing to consider when making life choices - [[I should always be content with the choices I make|being content with them]]
