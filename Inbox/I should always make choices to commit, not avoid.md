A lot of times in my life I've tried to make the *right* choices and met with the same barrier. That barrier was the fact, that those choices required me to give up something I had and move on to something I didn't have yet. For example, my goal to become a musician by the time I finish university implied that I had to give up on - avoid - university and commit to a bare goal without any base in real life.
