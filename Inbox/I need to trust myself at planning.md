I am bad a planning. And it's not particularly good for productivity or spending my life intentionally.

The bigger problem stems from the fact that I don't trust myself in planning. As every time I try to, I inevitably end up doing things my own way. Usually that happens because there was a circumstance that didn't allow me to follow the plan to the word and so I start trying to change it on the fly and end up missing most of it. 

There are two things I can do to start planning well:

1. Don't expect that it will all work out. There will always be a circumstance or two that won't let you fully follow the plan. So instead expect that it won't be followed fully and ideally make the schedule more flexible.
2. Do trust yourself and be loyal enough to yourself in the past to follow through with the plan no matter what you think about it in the process.

With that hopefully it will get easier to follow the plan and eventually **I'll get better at it** with the help of my own feedback after following it as closely as possible.
