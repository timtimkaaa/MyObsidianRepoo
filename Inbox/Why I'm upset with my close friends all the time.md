Today I went for a walk with Anya (Fedya's girlfriend from Noggers) and I've noticed that things that usually upset me in my closer friends didn't really bother me in her case. 

I haven't thought about it much yet, but I think I get upset with my close friends more because I'm used to them being good friends and to their niceness, so instead I skip all that and think of how they were late or how they don't do the thing I want them to.

Also there are expectations. I don't have a lot of expectations from Anya, I still don't know that much about her. But when it comes to Egor, for example, I expect him to listen to my problems and when he doesn't I feel hurt and thus upset. 

In conclusion, I should pay less attention to things that upset me in my friends, and more attention to things that I love my friends for.
