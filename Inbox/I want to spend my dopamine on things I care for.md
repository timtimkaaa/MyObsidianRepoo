In our modern world attention and time are the most valuable resources, and it is easy to spend them on thing you don't are for... **But** there is another integral aspect of life - *happiness*. We can get it from many sources and for our body, it will feel the same. Although **the emotions, memories, legacy and long term effects that it comes with it can be very different**.

Say I get joy out of helping someone out vs. I get joy from watching a mildly interesting video. Those two will give me about the same amount of joy. But the next day I will feel good about the former, but I won't feel anything or maybe even guilt about the latter. It will also contribute to my reputation, reinforce this habit of helping people. 

So I really should concentrate on what sources are best to get joy from, instead of were there's most of it. Also I should take into consideration that [[Happiness is a finite resource]] and I should be careful with it.
