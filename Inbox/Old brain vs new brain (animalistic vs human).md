This is a very very simple representation of how a brain works. 

We can roughly separate our brain into 2 parts: old brain and new brain. 

### Old brain

There are parts of our brain that we can trace back hundreds of millions of years. Some scientists talk about these parts being involved with the four "F"s: feeding, fighting, fleeing and... having sex. Also since we're mammals these parts are responsible for us taking care of children. Besides that, the "old brain" is also responsible for basic emotions, such as anxiety, anger and joy; sexual interest and motives; forming friendships; and belonging to groups. 

So to rephrase, our Old Brain takes care of:
- **The four "F"s**
	- Feeding
	- Fighting
	- Fleeting
	- Fucking - sexual interests and motives
- ~={yellow}**Learning by conditioning**=~
- ~={yellow}**Basic emotions**=~, e.g. 
	- anxiety
	- anger
	- fear
	- sadness
	- lust
	- joy
- **Basic safety reflexes**, e.g.
	- Withdrawal (getting the hand off a hot surface)
- **Socializing**
	- Forming friendships
	- Belonging to groups


### New brain

The new brain gives us the capacity for: 
- language
- thinking
- imagination
- planning
- conceptualization 
- problem-solving
- self-awareness

It also gives us more ways to learn, **besides conditioning**. We can learn through:
- consequences
- observation
- deduction
- indirect experience

### How this relates to anxiety

The issue arises in collision of the old and the new brain.

 Let's use an example. Jennifer's "old brain" is preconditioned by evolution to fight, flight or freeze; seek status, approval, attachment to others and fear being ostracized.

Her personal history (nerdy middle school student, bullied at a school dance) emphasized and reinforced her need to seek approval and be afraid of social rejection. This way she was conditioned to feel anxiety from activities involving social evaluation. 

Additionaly there was a threat to her romantic attachment (partner said they need to date different people for some time, while she wanted to get married soon). That would raise the anxiety threshold too.

When losing relationships in such ways it's conmon to feel anxiety, which is another example of how anxiety interacts with our sense of safety created by secure and compassionate relationships.

All of this - the motivations, the learned behaviors and the emotions all came from the "old brain".

Then the "new brain" would start reacting to the stirrings "old brain". Laying in bed at night, her "old brain" would make her tell herself: 

>"*I’m going to be like this forever—I know it. Everyone at school can see I’m a nervous wreck, and there’s just no way out. I’m a fraud. I try to seem so competent, but I’m barely functioning. Who’d want to be with a person like this? No wonder my boyfriend left me. I’m going to die alone after living in a squalid apartment with thirty cats!*".

And then her "new brain" would conjure up corresponding images. She would see herself being laughed at, almost smell the old apartment she would end up in. 

Her “new brain” had a necessary tendency to respond to imaginary things as if they were real, and this meant that her heart would pound, her stomach would churn, and **her body and mind would prepare themselves for what they perceived to be a life-threatening situation**, despite the fact that she was lying safely in bed, miles away from such an experience.
