This is a very very simple representation of how a brain works. 

We can roughly separate our brain into 2 parts: old brain and new brain. 

### Old brain

There are parts of our brain that we can trace back hundreds of millions of years. Some scientists talk about these parts being involved with the four "F"s: feeding, fighting, fleeing and... having sex. Also since we're mammals these parts are responsible for us taking care of children. Besides that, the "old brain" is also responsible for basic emotions, such as anxiety, anger and joy; sexual interest and motives; forming friendships; and belonging to groups.
