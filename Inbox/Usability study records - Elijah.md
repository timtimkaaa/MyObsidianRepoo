## Prompts for tasks performed

- Prompt 1: Imagine you're at a store and you're struggling to find a product. Let's say you need vegan milk. Now open up the Grocery Locator app on your phone and try to find and locate it.
- Prompt 2: Now, let's take a different situation: you're making a grocery list before going shopping. Try to create one and add that 2 bottles of Vegan milk there. 
- Prompt 3: Now let's say before you buy that milk, you want to check if there are any sales for one of the brands of milk.
- Prompt 4: Now let's go back to that list you were making earlier. Let's imagine these recommended products are also worth buying, so let's add them, and try use navigator to shop. How do you think you can do that?
