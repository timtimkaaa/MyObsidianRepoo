I’ve been designing for 12 years — here’s what I wished someone had told me about learning UX design when I was first starting out. I strongly believe that you don’t need an expensive course or a degree for this.

Here’s a no-BS guide with 8 tactical steps to become a UX designer:

1. Learn technique by copying  
    - Download Figma  
    - Screenshot your favorite web/mobile app  
    - Recreate 1–2 screens in Figma  
    - Use Figma’s help center & Discord if stuck  
    - Design 50 screens this way.  
      
    In my first few years as a designer, I ended up doing 75 projects. You'll stumble but will build stronger technical abilities than most university grads.
2. Mock projects  
    - Generate a prompt at [sharpen.design](https://t.co/kFQzdVXquk "t.co")  
    - Give yourself 3-7 days to attempt it  
    - Google each stage of the design process; spend 1 day applying each stage (eg: research, ideation, prototyping, etc)  
    - Document everything & present in a Notion doc  
    - Get critiqued on it at the end of the week (see Step 3 below)  
    - Complete 10 mock projects  
      
    This is an upgrade from the first step, you will now start applying the technical skills you formed above.
3. Weekly design critiques  
    - Go to ADPList website (100% free; I’m not paid to recommend it)  
    - Schedule calls with 'entry-level' designers (2-3 yrs of exp)  
    - Ask for a design critique on 1 project every week  
    - In the call, share your challenges  
    - Repeat *every* week  
      
    You can't design in a void, you need real-world feedback and this is how you get it.
4. Actively train your design eye  
    - Every day, pick a design category (eg: logo design)  
    - Browse 10–15 designs in this category (on Behance, Dribbble, 99Designs)  
    - Spend 1min on each piece and put it into 'good' or 'bad' design category + note why  
      
    This will help you start developing an intuition for what good & bad design means.
5. Passive design inspiration- Increase the surface area to get design inspiration  
    - Replace your Chrome new tab with Panda plugin  
    - Sign up for curated design newsletters (eg: [uxdesignweekly.com](https://t.co/25OJcPAC6i "t.co"))  
    - Pay attention to design choices around you (eg: in a grocery store)  
      
    This will help you get design inspiration which you will in turn apply to weekly projects.
6. Watch YouTube videos (30 mins/day)Find good design content on YouTube. Search:  
    - Recorded talks from old conferences (eg: [youtube.com/c/WeAreDesignX](https://t.co/xr0mjNhKxr "t.co"))  
    - Mock design interviews (eg: [youtube.com/watch?v=E8HJLU](https://t.co/XF63BFp8nN "t.co"))  
    - Design vlogs or critiques  
      
    Immerse yourself in all things design.
7. Real-world projects  
    Once you've done 10–20 mock projects and gotten critiques on it, it's time to apply your learnings:  
    - Email local NGOs to volunteer free design help (website upgrade, logo, etc)  
    - Check 99Designs, Upwork, etc for small projects  
    - Participate in hackathons  
    - Do this for experience & learning, not money
8. Find community online  
    - Join Slack communities ([designerslack.community](https://t.co/1WKyeDvVgY "t.co"))  
    - Attend free design events online  
    - Find good designers on Twitter and ask them questions, etc  
      
    The goal is to meet like-minded people at a similar stage, and to learn + grow with others.

That’s it. If you follow this process rigorously for at least 3 months, you will sky-rocket in your ability to think, design, and iterate on your craft. I’ve also written some other guides & answers that you might find valuable:
