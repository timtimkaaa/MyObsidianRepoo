Hi again, today I realized it was impolite to not greet you.

Today was a good, but under-productive day. 

So I woke up at 8:50 to get a little more sleep, then went on to do the morning routine. Which I almost got the splits. 

Then I went outside for a quick go at the local outdoors gym. Felt good and I was actually able to do 5 in one go even though I haven't been doing pull-ups for half a year. 

Then I studied, but I was a bit lazy because the weather was so great. I watched dogs play and people walk around. 

After I ate lunch(watching videos) a little too long I played a recruiter for Vova, because he needed to train for job interviews.

After doing that and of course talking with Vova I missed quite a bit of the work time, so I got back to it till 6, when I had a call with parents and then went to Ilya to write some music. 
We finished the song, or at least I did, but after having Vitya listen to it, Ilya will be polishing and reworking it. I'm fine with it as I already took too big of a part in it's creation and left little for Ilya.

Now I'm home and going to sleep feeling really fulfilled and ready to meet tomorrow. Maybe it's the weather and maybe I just had a good day. Most likely both.

The only thing is I have to work more ðŸ˜“ðŸ¥²
