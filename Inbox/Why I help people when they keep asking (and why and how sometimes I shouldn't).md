Say, someone comes up to me and asks for something, and I say no. But they keep asking and asking... I almost universally agree. 

Here are the why's of it:

1. **Consistency with self image**. I consider myself a kind and caring person, so I don't want to contradict that idea by not helping.
2. **Relationship trust**. I help you when you need my help, so I can trust you to help me when I come to you.
3. **Foot-in-the-door effect**. The more they persist, the more tired of it I get and the more I want it to stop. So I cave in and do it.
4. **Empathy**. I feel for them, so I want to help them. 
5. **Childhood** I was afraid of doing wrong things and I did anything possible to avoid it. Not helping someone - especially in family - would definitely count as wrong.
6. **Overthinking**. I start thinking of the great circumstances that this small decision will do. In reality it's as routine and forgetful,.as most other interactions.
