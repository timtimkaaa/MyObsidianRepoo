You know you've felt it, so it's time to shed some light of consciousness on it.

Firstly, you literally **have a limited amount of it per day**. So if you enjoy something too much in the morning, your body is going to go into saving mode, and you're going to feel worse in the evening. That's just science.

But aside from that, there's *another* algorithm that made primitive people work: **you can't get unlimited joy out of one and the same thing**. The more you do it, the less fun you're having. That's [[Boredom|boredom]] for you. 
 
So, [[I want to spend my dopamine on things I care for]]
