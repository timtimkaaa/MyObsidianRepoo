From my own experience trying to prove people wrong, change their mind, or them doing it to me, I've realized that one could only do that if the person in question is already inclined to change their mind. 

It makes sense, because when people have a strong unshaken opinion, they'll find all the arguments they need to support it.

While in a case, where a person feels that there's something wrong with their point already, their defences will be weak enough to let your arguments through.
