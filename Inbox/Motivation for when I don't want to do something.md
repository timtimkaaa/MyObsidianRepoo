Heyyyy, I guess you need some motivation for doing something. Here are some ideas that might help. Also from me writing this, good luck!

1. Remember why you're doing this in the first place
	- Even if you feel like you don't want to do this right now, think of what the big picture represents to you. Yes this task might be boring or not to your liking, but you're doing it for the bigger project.
2. You're training your discipline muscle
	- Every single time you want to quit is an opportunity
	- And every time you use this opportunity, you get stronger in terms of discipline
3. Think about the positives
	- You can find problems with any task and you're actively doing that with this one. 
	- It's not your fault, that you feel this way, your body resents the task for some reason - and you should actually ask yourself why it does that.
	- But anyways, focus on all the fun parts this task offers.
4. Just do it for 10 minutes
	- You know the idea, sometimes you don't want to do something because it seems like a big thing, so why not do it for just 10 minutes.
	- And if you still don't feel like it after 10 minutes, think about picking up a different task.
5. Maybe your body's having a physical problem
	- Maybe you didn't go outside for a while, or overate, etc.
