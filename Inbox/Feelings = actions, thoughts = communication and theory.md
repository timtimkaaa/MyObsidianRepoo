I've noticed a big difference between myself and people like Vova or Egor. And here I'll try to understand it better.

Unlike me, Vova and Egor both use feelings instead of thoughts to understand the world, and both prefer actions over communication. And I think these two are connected.

I think that when you love through feelings more than thoughts, you are not as good at using thoughts, for example for communication. But feeling do naturally make you take action. So I think that operations the world with feelings makes you more actionable, why operations the world with thoughts makes you more "theoretical". 

Both are good, and both are valid ways to see the world. But both have their disadvantages. 

I think in my case I prefer to be somewhere in the middle, because I think I've moved far too much into the "thinking" side lately.
