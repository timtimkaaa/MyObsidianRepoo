"Sometimes life gives us chances". Or more accurately, life constantly offers us choices that shape our future. Those choices form a path, that *ideally* leads to our goals. But to make it lead to our goals we have to make the *right* choices that get us closer to those goals. This is something obvious we all know. But of course there's more to it.

This book suggests, that there are no good or bad choices in life and there's no way to evaluate their quality in the first place. **But choices can be honest and dishonest towards ourselves**. The sense of life is in enjoying it after all, and since we're humans who enjoy very certain (even if complicated) thing. So our goals are after all something that we feel good about. We might not necessarily enjoy them, but we will feel no inner conflict when doing them. And doing those things we feel content about will let us reach our goals in the end. 

**Everyone's path is unique and different**, even if some of us strive for the same goals. But we can all do it, no matter what shape our path will be. ~={yellow}**If we choose the path of content and honesty with ourselves, without any doubt, we are able to get there and enjoy the whole journey**.=~

But it's important to not only make *honest* choices, but also to make them [[I should always make choices from the place of positivity|from a place of positivity]]
