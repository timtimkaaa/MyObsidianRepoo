I've had a lot of situations, when I felt like someone owes me, because I've been doing things for them and didn't get enough/anything back. But I think I've come up with a way to fix that. Presenting...

>[!tip] Help people only as much as your good will allows you. 
>In other words - only help people when you feel like it and don't expect anything back from them. 
 
~={cyan}*For example*=~, I helped Vova fix his car ceiling and halfway through I was really not liking it - it took too long, it was really frustrating and I didn't want to do it anymore. **That's where the good will ends** - and that's where I should've stopped. *Then I wouldn't feel like Vova owes me*and I wouldn't be frustrated with him still owing me 2 months later. 

Of course in that same case he could've still really asked for me to help - leveraged our relationship. In that case, I could've agreed to help, but not out of good will, but for payment - a favor, money or a sneakers bar.

In this way we have separate ideas of good will and service, both of which are a way to help someone out.
