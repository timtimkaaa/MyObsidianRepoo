Anxiety comes from the Latin *anxius* - meaning "feeling of agitation and upset".

Anxiety is one of the most prevalent and challenging forms of human suffering, and it can vary in intensity from mild tension and apprehension to feelings of fear and terror. It can make us want to run away, scream, feel heartbroken, make us collapse in a ball or simply go quiet.

During periods of anxiety, our thinking is focused on threats of potential harm and loss, and we can feel an urgent need to run, avoid, squeeze, or faint. These responses can be triggered very rapidly and often well before we're aware of it happening.

We don't choose to have flushes of anxiety, they're a part of our physiological make up and are there to protect us from possibly harmful situations.
