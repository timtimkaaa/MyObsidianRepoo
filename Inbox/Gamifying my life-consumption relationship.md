This is my first try at creating a system for this, except for the todo lists.

Let's divide my life into 2 categories: *Content* and *Living*. There's a lot more to my life than this, but basically I'm dividing my life into living *my life* and *someone else's*. This also correlates with *healthy pleasure* vs. *unhealthy drug-ish pleasure*.

With that in mind I want to gamify these by making myself earn consumption time by living. 

1hr of living => 0,5hr of consuming. Middleground activities don't do anything.

Living:
- Working
- Studying
- Talking to people
- Doing active activities
- Reading books
- Making art
- Singing (even to a song)
- Analysing art
- Not thinking 
- Meditating

Consuming:
- Learning things I'm not very interested in
- Passive listening
- Watching youtube videos without intent
- Doing things for no particular reason
- Listening to non-ambient music in the background

There also appears to be a lot of stuff in the middleground:
- Active listening
- Listening to music
- Active watching
- Eating in silence
