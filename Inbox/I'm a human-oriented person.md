**Hear me out**. Of course the whole idea of dividing all the people into two groups goes against my beliefs and is just not good in general. But I do believe that there is some truth to it.

I think that one of the major differences between human-oriented people (гуманитариями) and technically-oriented people (технари) is their... well orientation. Or in other words, what their core interests are. In my case I can definitely say that I am very interested in studying people. How they think, how they work, what the want and *especially* how they interact. That might be a big reason why I am so interested in arts, psychology, philosophy and now UX design. In comparison I could look at my very close friend - Egor. He is much more interested in algorithms and how they work. Why a tree moves, why a rocket flies etc. 

While both tap into the idea of deep understanding of algorithms - mine is more focused on the **emotional** side of the **human** "algorithms". That's the focus and end point of most things I do. 

It could also be that I'm wrong, but we'll see...
