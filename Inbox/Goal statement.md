### Goal statement template

First, let’s briefly review the elements of a goal statement. A goal statement can be written using this simple formula:

1. **Product:** Start with your product. This could be an app, an object, or anything else. 
2. **Action:** Describe the specific action your product enables users to perform. 
3. **Audience:** Describe who the action will primarily affect. This could be the user themselves.
4. **Impact:** Describe how the action will positively affect that person.
5. **Criteria:** Describe how you’ll measure the action’s effectiveness.

If you need help identifying these attributes of your goal statement, the “who” can come from the persona, the “what” could come from the user story, and the “why” can come from the empathy map and user journey maps you have applied to this problem in the past. You may also use the information provided solely in the problem scenario.


### *E.g. CoffeeHouse goal statement*

*In the example we’re exploring, the CoffeeHouse app designer develops a goal statement for Anika, one of the project’s user personas. The designer uses the goal statement to present  a solution to Anika’s problem statement.*

- ***Anika problem statement:** Anika is a busy marketing intern who needs a faster, more collaborative way to take many coffee orders at once because taking individual orders takes too long and isn’t a good use of Anika’s time.* 

*Based on this problem statement, the designer develops this goal statement for users like Anika.*

- ***Goal statement:** The CoffeeHouse app will let users place group orders in advance, which will affect users who have to make and pick up large orders by letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app.*

The goal statement is successful because it: 

- Identifies the **product:** an app that will be created
- Defines the **action the product lets people perform:** placing group orders in advance
- Indicates **who the action will affect:** people who need to make and pick up large orders
- Describes **how the action will affect them:** letting them skip the line and save time
- Defines **how the app’s effectiveness will be measured:** tracking orders placed through the app

After exploring multiple iterations of the CoffeeHouse app example, you should be noticing how earlier parts of the empathize and define phases lay foundations for later parts. For instance, the goal statement above doesn’t mention Anika specifically, but the designer would have had a hard time arriving at that goal statement without defining a user persona like Anika. By encapsulating a large chunk of user information, this user persona helped the CoffeeHouse designer empathize with an important group of similar users and ultimately set a design goal to meet those users’ similar needs.
