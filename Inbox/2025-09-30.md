It was a good day today (after all). I was a bit too distracted with media, but still focused on working and got the results.

In the morning I woke up tired, because I was a bit restless in the night, so it took me a while to fully come to my senses.

Then I ate breakfast and washed myself and immediately got into content. But I also made myself study. 

After that I worked, but they set a ridiculous expiration time, so my task expired and I didn't earn anything. Ouch, but also whatever, I wasn't in the mood anyways.

Then I took a walk while talking to my parents and then met with Egor. He was veeery silent today, but Egor do be doing that a lot. I guess maybe he's still a bit weak from being sick.

Also we went to hebe and Pepco together and that was fun. I bought myself a "female" razor, a lipstick and some of those small candles. Also I loooveee these wood wick candles, they're amazing. Although they tend to be very dim.

Then I came home, didn't really do any drawing :( Instead I ate, but in my defence, it was low in calories.

Now I'm going to sleep and even though I was upset with myself all day, I actually feel thankful and satisfied with myself.
