### Consider the research goals *(empathetic questions to ask)*

To craft the ~={yellow}project goals=~, effective designers often start by considering empathetic questions like these:
- ~={yellow}Who=~ are my ~={yellow}users=~ and ~={yellow}what problems or needs=~ is my product aiming to solve?
- ~={yellow}What about my users=~ do I want to learn from the interviews? 
- Are there certain~={yellow} user problems or pain points=~ I need to learn more about?

***E.g.***
*1. I want to understand **common challenges** people face when trying to **manage a busy schedule** and when **meal planning**.*
*2. I want to identify **frustrations** people experience during the process of **ordering from a restaurant**.*

### Consider the participant characteristics *(user-related questions to ask)*

To define a ~={yellow}diverse but manageable=~ group of participants, designers often start by considering questions like these:

- ~={yellow}Who=~ are my ~={yellow}end users=~ and ~={yellow}what=~ are their ~={yellow}**key characteristics**=~? Key characteristics include things like ~={cyan}**age, location, career, gender, disability**=~, and so on.
- ~={yellow}How=~ might ~={cyan}**these**=~ characteristics ~={yellow}**shape users’ experiences**=~ with or ~={yellow}**feelings**=~ about my product or similar products?

***E.g.** For the Zia’s Pizza app, the ideal interview participants represent the app’s end users. They:*
- *Are aged **18–62***
- *Live in **metropolitan** or **suburban** areas*
- *Order food from restaurants **at least once a week***
- *Include people of **different genders*** 
- *Include people with **disabilities***

### Consider the interview questions *(5 characteristics of a good question)*

First, here's an example of good interview questions:

***E.g.**
1. *What is your **current schedule** like? How do you balance your responsibilities with **meal planning**?*
2. ***How often** do you **order** meals from a **restaurant**? When you do, what is your **motivation?*** 
3. *What **challenges** do you face in the **ordering process**? How do these challenges **make you feel**?*
4. *How do you think these challenges could be resolved?*


Now, ~={yellow}effective interview questions=~ have ~={yellow}five=~ characteristics. They are: 
#### Relevant

The example questions below are ~={yellow}**relevant**=~ because they ~={yellow}align with the problem=~ the designer is trying to solve. They are designed to ~={yellow}gather information=~ about the ~={yellow}experiences, needs, or pain points=~ that users may have with the product or with similar products.

#### Open-ended

The example questions are ~={yellow}**open-ended**=~ in that they ~={yellow}invite=~ participants to share freely and elaborate. ~={yellow}None=~ can be answered with a simple “~={yellow}yes=~” or “~={yellow}no=~.” Unless a designer needs a definitive “yes” or “no” answer to a particular question, open-ended questions will almost always generate richer and deeper information about users’ experiences.
#### Neutral

The questions are also ~={yellow}**neutral**=~, which means they are ~={yellow}not designed to lead or pressure=~ participants toward a ~={yellow}desired response=~. For comparison, consider this leading, non-neutral question: “When you order meals from a restaurant, is it because you don’t have time to cook or because you don’t want to cook?” This question makes assumptions about users’ motivations and leads them into specific kinds of answers. In contrast, neutral questions will invite participants to share without assuming, anticipating, or directing their responses.

#### Clear

Notice how~={yellow} short and simple=~ the questions are. They will be easy for interview participants to understand and answer because they are conversational and straightforward.

#### Designed for follow-up

Finally, notice how the questions are designed for ~={yellow}**follow-up**=~. Questions 1–3 all have two parts. The interviewer might start with the first part and then prompt participants to elaborate with the second part. During the **empathize phase** of the design process, interviews should be ~={yellow}conversational=~, so encouraging participants to ~={yellow}elaborate=~ is a best practice.  Effective designers often~={yellow} follow up=~ with simple prompts like ~={yellow}“Tell me more about that”=~ or with classic ~={yellow}“Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How”=~ questions.
