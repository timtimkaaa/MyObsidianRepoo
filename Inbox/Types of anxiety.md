>[!info] Anxiety is unique to everyone, because our distinct personal histories and moment-to-moment experiences interact with and influence our emotions, thoughts and actions. 
> 
> These variations may relate to 
> - what causes us anxiety
> - how easily our anxiety is triggered
> - how intense it is
> - how frequent it is
> - the ways we physically and psychologically experience the anxiety
> - how long it lasts
> - and how easily or quickly we can calm down after becoming anxious.

Also anxiety takes different forms. For example, some people can have intense and sudden physical symptoms, known as **panic attacks**, that seem to come randomly and fill a person with a feeling of impending doom. 

Other people can suffer from more **generalized anxiety**, in which they experience worries throughout the day about a variety of situations. Generalized anxiety can involve hours lost to immersion in negative predictions.

People with **social anxiety** can become particularly concerned about social interactions, fearing people might see them as inadequate or inferior, and thus reject them.

Other people focus on their bodily problems, worrying illness and disease.

Finally there are **specific phobias** - anxieties over specific things, such as spiders, snakes or heights.
