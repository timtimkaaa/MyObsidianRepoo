Last time we met Egor complained how people complain all the time about how the world is hard instead of enjoying the good things and diligently working to fix the bad ones. While that's definitely a good solution, I think it doesn't always apply.

I take myself as the biggest example of this: [[Why I don't believe in ultimate truths (and lack self-esteem)]]

This is one example of just how unfair a world can be. There there would be no "just think positively and fix problems". This was a point where none of it would work and I'm really grateful to myself, my friends and my parents for me not being like this anymore. 

Even so, this example show that we can really work on ourselves to make the world a fair place towards ourselves and even others. But that's not something to automatically expect from anyone and not doing this is definitely not a reason to hate or disregard or belittle someone (or their experience).
