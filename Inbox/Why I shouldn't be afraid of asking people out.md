All my life I've been afraid of asking people out because of a very strong fear of rejection. But the older I get the easier it gets for me to talk to people and to meet new people. So the logical next step is to finally start asking people out.

### 1. I'm doing it out of good will

I'm only doing it because I enjoy a persons company and want to try give it a try. There's no ill intent there, and even if they feel any - that's not for me to worry about. Don't forget, **what other people feel is their responsibility**. I didn't intend any harm, so if it did make them feel bad, it's unfortunate, but also not my fault.

### 2. There's nothing wrong with asking someone out whatsoever

It's not insulting or putting them into an uncomfortable situation. It's just a proposal that they can agree to or deny. *If done right* it also doesn't put any pressure on the person in question.

### 3. They might like me

Even though my self-esteem has always been low, I do look good and I have already met people who where attracted by my looks. Besides that, I know a fact that I'm a good friend, I'm comfortable to be around, and last but definitely not least, I'm interesting, So, there's a pretty high chance that the person in question has been interested in me. After all if I enjoy being around them, what are the chances they don't feel the same. 

### 4. I'm good at talking

While I don't have experience dating or romantic communication, I am still really good at talking and communication overall. So even though whenever it comes to dating I become this scared teenager, I'm not like this anymore. I really know how to talk and how to enjoy someone's company. And this is not particularly different from regular conversations.

So go ahead and give that person a chance to see for themselves, how cool you are and give yourself a chance to see if they're your type. This could be your life partner, but it's also just another person.
