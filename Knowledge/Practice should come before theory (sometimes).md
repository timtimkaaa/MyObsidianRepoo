Have you ever been in a situation, where you're learning hard, but the next day you barely remember anything? Here's why...


It's pretty hard to learn new things, especially if you're just starting a new learning journey. The way memory works, is it ~={yellow}connects ideas to other ideas=~. In the case of learning ~={cyan}something new=~, it's very hard to connect things you learn to any other knowledge or experience you have (because you don't really have any). Which is why, ~={yellow}you have to get the experience first=~.

~={yellow}The way to do it is practice=~. *Not the other way around*. When you practice - you gain that experience, even if it's bad, you not only **learn from your mistakes**, but also **find more refined techniques** through learning theory afterwards.
