I've spent many hours trying to understand the choices other people make to no avail. It was always so hard to realize, **why one would find something I hate, to be so good for them**. And sometimes I even got to the answer one way or another.

The real answer to this is - **the things I find good for myself are only like this because they fit well with all the other things I do**. For example, *I need to talk to other people every 1 or 2 days to feel good*. It is like this because I have some **beliefs** and **psychological features** that make me need to talk. Also it fits well within my lifestyle. 

Another example is *I need to do sports at least every other day*. This is **conditioned** by the unique way my body functions, and my other habits like eating and drinking a lot, not having a lot of places to go to every day.

In the same way **all my preferences are conditioned by circumstance and other preferences**. And odds are, the same piece doesn't fit in other person's puzzle. So I should make less hasty decisions about someone's choices and come from a place of understanding, not righteous indignation.
