Examples of lenses: 
Psychoanalytic - understanding the characters' mental and emotional states
Feminist - examining the story through the lens of women's experiences
Marxist - socio-economic issues within the text by thinking of it as a product of the society it came from
Queer - queer identities and the 'queering' of characters, actions or speech.
