### Script interview questions

Develop a ~={yellow}**list of questions**=~ that you’ll ask all of the users you interview. It's considered a best practice to ~={yellow}keep **interview questions** fairly **consistent**=~ across users, but this list of questions is just a guide. You can deviate from the questions you prepared, if necessary, to learn more about the user and their pain points.

### Collect supplies

Create a ~={yellow}**checklist**=~ of items you'll need for the interview, such as a computer, a printed list of questions, or paper and a pencil.~={yellow} If you're using new equipment=~ or technology during the interview, make sure you ~={yellow}know how it works in advance=~**.

### Research the users

Take time to ~={yellow}**learn what you can about the people**=~ you’ll interview. If the users you’re preparing to interview provide their ~={yellow}**personal information**=~ before the interview, be sure to take note of it. This information might include their name, demographic information, relevant experience with the product you’re designing, or details about how they learned about the interview. You can use this information to ~={yellow}**extend the conversation**=~ during the interview and ~={yellow}**build rapport**=~. When you work for an organization, you can also **screen** participants on sites like LinkedIn to confirm they are who they say they are. You wouldn’t want to accidentally interview someone who is working for the competition!

### Practice

It’s always a good idea to ~={yellow}**practice delivering the questions**=~ you’ll ask users before you conduct a real interview. This gives you time to make changes to the questions you’re planning to ask and helps ensure that the interviews run smoothly. Practicing is also a good way to determine if the length of the interview is appropriate, or if you need to add or cut questions from your list. You can practice asking interview questions in front of a mirror or with a trusted colleague.
