~={yellow}**“How might we” (HMW)**=~ is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design. 

HMW gets your creativity flowing and encourages you to think about the problem from **different perspectives**. This new vantage point helps you create a **wide variety** of solutions to the user problem you’re trying to address. 

During a HMW exercise, you’d create a list of questions that start with “How might we” and use those to spark ideas for solutions.

### Frame HMW questions

To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem statement. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the problem.

*E.g. Consider this problem that a user, Darren, faces: 
> Darren is a concert goer who needs to keep track of their concert ticket because they need the ticket when they go through security.* 

Use the Stanford University HMW tips:

- **Amp up the good**
	- Think of how you might use any ~={yellow}positives in the problem=~ as a solution. 
	- _How might we make keeping track of tickets a fun competition among friends?_
- **Explore the opposite**
	- Think of how you’d solve the ~={yellow}opposite of the problem=~ you’ve outlined. 
	- _How might we create a way to lose tickets?_
- **Change a status quo**
	- Think of ways to ~={yellow}completely change the process=~. 
	- _How might we make a non-paper concert ticket?_
- **Break the point of view into pieces**
	- This is especially helpful for long, complex problems. 
	- _How might we keep the customer’s ticket from getting lost? How might we make a lost ticket easier for the security team to handle?_
- **Remove the bad**
	- Think of how to ~={yellow}remove the negative part=~ of the problem ~={yellow}entirely=~. 
	- _How might we make a way for concert goers to enter a venue without needing a ticket?_
- **Go after the adjective**
	- Take any negative ~={yellow}adjectives=~ and try to turn them ~={yellow}into positives=~. 
	- _How might we make the entry to a concert venue less stressful for ticket holders?_
- **Question an assumption**
	- ~={yellow}Remove or change=~ any ~={yellow}processes=~ that you ~={yellow}assume=~ have to be ~={yellow}in place=~.
	- _How might we remove the security check process at a concert?_
- **Create an analogy using the established need or context**
	- Think of ways to ~={yellow}compare=~ this user experience ~={yellow}to another experience=~.  
	- _How might we make going through security like playing a video game?_
- **Identify unexpected resources that can provide assistance**
	- Think of how the problem might be solved by a ~={yellow}resource that isn’t mentioned=~ in the problem statement. 
	- _How might facial recognition software help manage concert entry?_
