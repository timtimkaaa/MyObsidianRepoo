Thankfully, the organizations that license these tools maintain robust libraries of up-to-date training resources. Here are some links into key parts of the training libraries for Figma, Sketch, Freehand, and Zeplin.

## **Creator-made UX tutorials**

When in doubt, ask the internet! Whether you’re facing an unfamiliar new challenge or just looking for inspiration, there’s a good chance that some other UX practitioner has tried something similar to what you are working on. So, use Google and YouTube (including YouTube Shorts) to search for creator-made tutorials about different design tasks and tools. TikTok has also become a very popular place to share tips on Figma. These tips and tutorials are often really detailed, with explanations of specific pitfalls, features, and challenges you may not anticipate.

## **Open-source design templates**

In UX design, there’s often no need to reinvent the wheel. Many design tools host libraries of open-source templates, which are licensed to be publicly available for download and for personal and commercial use. With these templates, you can experiment with unfamiliar designs and quickly spin up new designs for your own work. They make it easy to keep features you like and tweak those you don’t. As you play with them, you’ll start to apply your own style and preferences. Here are links to template libraries from some leading design tools:
