- [[Information architecture]] 

- [[Sitemaps]] - like all good information architecture, this sitemap organizes the product by outlining its hierarchy and sequence:
	- Hierarchy refers to how topics are prioritized and subordinated. Hierarchies emphasize topics that are broader or more important, which in turn contain smaller or less important topics. In the sitemap above, for example, “Shop” is a major topic that contains smaller topics, like “Denim/Pants.”
	- Sequence refers to the order in which users can navigate through the product’s hierarchy, like navigating from the “Homepage” to “Shop” to “Denim/Pants” and so on.

- [[Wireframing (paper and digital)]] - are rough sketches of the product that bring the sitemap to life. Designers use them to figure out how the product’s pages are laid out, how each page’s elements are arranged, and how users will progress from page to page. They are relatively bare bones, consisting primarily of shapes, lines, and minimal text. There are two methods designers can employ:

## **Paper wireframes**

Paper wireframes are sketches on paper. They use horizontal lines to represent text, rectangles or boxes to represent icons or images, and other shapes to represent buttons and additional elements. It’s easy and inexpensive to iterate many versions with paper.

## **Digital wireframes**

Digital wireframes are developed in a UX design tool such as Figma or Adobe XD. Digital wireframes are 2D designs that show, at a high level, what the product will look like. Designers use grayscale, shapes, and placeholder text to demonstrate what the design will look and feel like when content is added. (On a fun side-note: **Lorem ipsum** is a form of placeholder text that is so common that many designers like to play around with it for fun, to inspire creativity.
