Like affinity maps but with time axis

* Get a biggg sheet of paper
* Sticky notes with info from notes:
	* Direct quotes (MOST of them)
	* User goals
	* User actions
	* Pain points
* Put a sticky note up and call it out loud, so other can put similar ones next to it
* Spread out big clusters of sticky notes, or combine small groups, but ask others if they agree (Are those really separate actions)
* If people or info on sticky notes disagree, there's something interesting there. Dig in to resolve disagreement
* 
* Label each group (Task) with other color sticky note
* Tidy up, and make it so that all the Tasks are arranged chronologically, and notes in a group are under their Tasks notes
* Sets of Tasks => Activities
* 
* End up with:   Activities : (Tasks : (Sticky notes with observations))
* Not time for Design ideas, but if have, put them on with different color. It's interpretation, which can be bad at this point, but got to get it out of your head.
* More questions (what else wanted to observe or need research) - other color
* 
* If got a lot of user attribute notes, that are not used here, good. They're very useful later for the Persona process
* If multiple observers: can put initials in corner (to know, who to get clarification from)
* DON'T use digital products, bc harder to move things around, so you do it less. Can take a photo instead
