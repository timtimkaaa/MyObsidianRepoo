* Don't ask what or how to fix, bc/ users will give biased and limited answers, *instead* just observe
* Before going, plan:
	* Who are your target user types?
	* Where do they do their work
	* What type of activity do you want to observe?
	* 3+ different visits for each target user type
	* 5+ in total
	* Try to observe them exactly with items, and at the time and place they usually do the activities
	* If interview look at the past (experiences) not future (something they've never done)
	* 2-3 team members on each visit (no more, no less)
* Do
	* Interview < observation, but do both
	* Less talking, asking and interrupting, more observing
	* Write down FACTS
	* Look at the past (experiences) not future (something they've never done)
	* Can ask to think out loud 
	* Better not to record, as it may change how users react, no time to watch the tapes and I'm less concentrated, bc can watch later
	* No laptop, bc too intrusive and barrier between me and user
	* Can clarify, but don't ask
	* Use "humble apprentice" role when interviewing
	* Capture quotes
	* **Listen or Ask for USER GOALS:
		* “How does this **problem impact you**?”
		- ” How did you **solve / get around** that issue?”
		- “What’s the **hardest / most frustrating part about** …?”
		- “If you had a **magic wand, what would you change**?”
	* Note actions they take to get goals
	* Take photos of environment (if allowed)
	* Engage (smile, body lang)
	* Use open ended questions to keep the conversation going
		* “**Tell me about** …”
		- “**Why** do you …”?
		- “**What** is / are …?”
		- “**What** … do you use / do ?”
		- “**Describe to me** how you… / your experience with…?”
		- “**How often** do you…?” (to ask about frequency and quantity)
		- “**How much/many**…” (can also be used to probe level of knowledge like “how much do you know about this topic?”)
	- Use starter questions to understand how people perform tasks and activities.
		- “**How** do you {task}…?” (direct)
		- “**Describe how** **you would** {task}?” (indirect)
		- “**What** are all the things you need **to do** and **know** in order to {task}?”
		- Sequence: “**Walk me through** the steps, how do you {task}?”
		- Comparison: “**What is the difference** between {task} and {another task}?”
	* Ask for examples (times when *IT* happened)
	* If confused, what user says, wait till they've finished => "Can you **tell me more/ explain**, about what you just did"
	* Ask if they have questions
	* Pay with money, or gifts (especially brand promotion items from company)
* DON'T
	* engage in convo
	* write down solution or fixes
	* try to sell users on your ideas
	* ask to predict future

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                             | **To generate new knowledge** about your users, their experiences, needs, and pain points                                   | **To assess a design**: how it performs, what’s not working, and why                                    |
| Research type                       | **Attitudinal**: we collect participants’ reported behaviors, thoughts, and feelings                                        | **Behavioral**: we directly observe how users interact with a design                                    |
| When used                           | <br>*Empathize* stage of the [design-thinking model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) (or in discovery)\| | **_Test_** stage of the design-thinking model (or when a team is working on a product in alpha or beta) |
| Design                              | **Absent**: participants don’t review or try a design                                                                       | **Present**: participants interact with a design                                                        |
| Facilitator–participant interaction | More natural interaction: regular eye contact, facilitators are warmer and approachable                                     | More rigid interaction: Sporadic eye contact; facilitators avoid being too friendly                     |
