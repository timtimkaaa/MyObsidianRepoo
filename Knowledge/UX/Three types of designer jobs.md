- **Generalist**: A generalist has a broad number of responsibilities. A majority of UX design jobs are generalist positions, especially at companies with fewer UX designers. Typically, entry-level UX designers work in generalist roles, and some people choose to stay in generalist design roles for their entire careers. There are a lot of benefits to being a generalist UX designer, like: 
	- Expanding your skills in many different types of UX work.
	
	- Trying a variety of responsibilities and finding an area of UX that you’re especially passionate about. 
	
	- Keeping your job feeling fresh and new, while doing a variety of tasks.

- **Specialist**: A specialist dives deep into one type of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design, and becomes an expert. Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies that have a lot of designers, like here at Google. Some of the benefits of becoming a specialist include:
	- Focusing on one type of design that you enjoy more than others.
	
	- Gaining deep knowledge of one type of design.
	
	- Becoming well-known in the industry for your expertise in a particular type of design.

- **T-shaped**: A T-shaped designer is a specialist who also has a lot of capabilities in other areas. T-shaped designers get their name because the stem (or vertical line) of a T represents their expertise in one area, while the top (or horizontal line) symbolizes their related skills in a broad number of areas. T-shaped designers are great to have on your team, since they come with the benefits of both specialists and generalists. The image below highlights some of the skills a T-shaped UX designer might have. In this example, the person is a visual design specialist but also has knowledge in other areas, like coding and prototyping.
