<h3>Senses (in UX)</h3>
* Vision 
	* *accessibility* : Make impure hues for colorblind people
	* Rely not only on colors: labels, shapes, images
	* Avoid red-green red-blue combo's as they can cause problems with discerning edges and make eyes tired quicker
* Hearing 
	* Often form of feedback
	* Not enough on its own
	* Accompany with visual cues and vibrations
	* Video captions for deaf and for noisy environments
* Touch
	* Contact with objects
	* Haptic perception is act of exploration and interaction with object through touch
	* Actions:
		* Motion - tracing contours and surface
		* Pressure - pressing, squeezing to sense density and structure
		* Enclosure -wrap hands around to feel shape, size, weight 
* Proprioception
	* Feeling our own body
	* Our spatial movements can be used as input
	* Actions: 
		* Rotate
		* Shake
		* Squeeze

<h3>Perception != Sense</h3>
It's a way we perceive what we sense

We have perceptual constancy for
* Shape
* Lightness
* Color 
* Distance
* Size 
* Location
* Timbre

[[Gestalt psychology]] - psychology of shape, and how we're able to recognize world as meaningful and complete objects, not a series of independent parts.
