Justice is never objective and is often (but not always) used as a persuasion technique by people who actually don't care about it. 

Just like weapons, it's not an ultimate argument of prevelence, rightfulness or correctness. And just like weapons, it's not important on its own, but in hands of a skillful user.

One should be cautious around people talking about justice and always question why and for what they're using it as an argument.
