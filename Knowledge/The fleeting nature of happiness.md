"And what is happiness than? Happiness is a mysterious thing, to be found somewhere between too little and too much."

Happiness is very illusive and skiddish. If we try and pursue it, it's nowhere to be found. It's like a butterfly: if we stay very still it may come and sit on our hand. 

Happiness is not something to be hunting for, it's something to be savored when it comes, and anticipated when it doesn't. It will come regardless of anything and obly when we allow it to.

"A cherry tree bowed down by the night's rain suddenly rights itself, flinging pellets of water in my face. This, too, is happiness."
