I believe that generalization is the force that makes people have so many contrary ideas and worldviews and what makes people ignorant to each other's truth.

The world is too complex to understand it wholely, so instead we focus on some things and generalize everything else. Unfortunately most of the time our generalizations, though useful at the moment, are very far from truth. 

And generalization is what most words are for. So when one shares their opinion or worldview with another, the words mean and imply very different ideas for each of them. 

So generalization is in a way a negative ignorance towards other people and the world around. But also it's an important optimisation technique for our mind that allows people to process the complex world around.

In conclusion, I shouldn't think of generalization negatively, but it's important to always recognize generalization and how much of a workaround it is. Meaning it's very far from actual truth.
