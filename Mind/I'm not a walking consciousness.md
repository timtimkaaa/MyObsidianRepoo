Most of my life, I thought of myself as a singular entity - the "I", or the soul with limbs and organs at it's command. Some time ago I started realizing that there's a lot more to it. *Here I'm going to only talk about brain and mind but it also extends to other parts of our body.*

Firstly, all parts of our body are **equal in power** and do **different** jobs to help each other. **Consciousness** - the "I" - only works together with them, doing it's own job - analytical thinking, decision-making and self-consciousness. While things like emotions, associations, habits and reflexes come from **subconsciousness** (umbrella-term for many organs). That's because It's responsible for quick actions and adaptation. Which means, it's **always changing and adapting**. 

Actually our subconsciousness is also responsible for such a big part of our thinking, that I believe [[How subconsiousness forms our world|it forms a whole worlds of it's own]], which people call inner world. And thus, it's very important to [[I should pay attention to my inner world|pay attention to that world]]
