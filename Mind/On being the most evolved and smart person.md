Return: [[Mind core]]

I was thinking about the industrial revolution and the hunt for the best most comfortable life. Which deserves a piece of its own -> [[NEW Industrial revolution]] 

From there I came back to a seemingly old idea I realized myself and noticed in many different places: improvement without a reason and no matter the cost. The thing that led the Industrial revolution and the expansions of the Roman Empire. -> [[Ruthless Improvement]]

But more importantly I had this idea about myself. If I become the best or invent a new genre of music that no one's ever heard, I'm going to be so happy. What I have come to realize is 'I don't need it'.
