Return: [[Mind core]]

I was thinking about the industrial revolution and the hunt for the best most comfortable life. Which deserves a piece of its own -> [[NEW Industrial revolution]] 

From there I came back to a very old idea I had myself and noticed in many different places: improvement without a reason and no matter the cost. The thing that led the Industrial revolution and the expansions of the Roman Empire.
