I was thinking about the industrial revolution and the hunt for the best most comfortable life. Which deserves a piece of its own -> [[NEW Industrial revolution]] 

From there I came back to a seemingly old idea I realized myself and noticed in many different places: improvement without a reason and no matter the cost. The thing that led the Industrial revolution and the expansions of the Roman Empire. -> [[NEW Ruthless Improvement]]

But more importantly I had this idea about myself. If I become the best or invent a new genre of music that no one's ever heard, I'm going to be so happy. What I have come to realize is 'I don't need it'.

### Art is a reaction

New genres form and get popular as a reaction to the state of the world. So there's no real reason to spend all my time trying "invent" a new genre. It's just not the way it works. Whenever the state of the world inspires me - it will come itself. 

Of course I should still work hard and better myself at producing music and capturing the ideas.

### I should aim for my own goals - not of others

I constantly want to live a better life, to be better myself. Which is not by any means bad. The problem lies in what I strive for. 

There are a lot of attractive goals being advertised in our culture - being rich, famous, influential, or the opposite - going to secluded farm, becoming a priest and so on.

These goals are attractive because they are being advertised. People show how cool it is to be this and that. And of course they mostly show the good parts, not forgetting that they are very different from me. When it comes to me, I have to figure out my own goals that would actually make me happy. 

I think just like in art, my goals should be formed more as a reaction to the state of the world around and inside me. There is no ultimate goal, and sometimes a goal can change to absolute opposite. 

What's important is to constantly check what dreams I'm following and if they're in line with my actual need. And not get mindlessly jealous of the people with their goals fulfilled - they already have new ones, and that was only good for *them* at the *right time*.
