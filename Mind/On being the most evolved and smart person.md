Return: [[Mind core]]

I was thinking about the industrial revolution and the hunt for the best most comfortable life. Which deserves a piece of its own -> [[NEW Industrial revolution]] 

From there I came back to a seemingly old idea I realized myself and noticed in many different places: improvement without a reason and no matter the cost. The thing that led the Industrial revolution and the expansions of the Roman Empire. -> [[Ruthless Improvement]]

But more importantly I had this idea about myself. If I become the best or invent a new genre of music that no one's ever heard, I'm going to be so happy. What I have come to realize is 'I don't need it'.

### Art is a reaction

New genres form and get popular as a reaction to the state of the world. So there's no real reason to spend all my time trying "invent" a new genre. It's just not the way it works. Whenever the state of the world inspires me - it will come itself. 

Of course I should still work hard and better myself at producing music and capturing the ideas.

### I should aim for my own goals - not of others

I constantly want to live a better life, to be better myself. Which is not by any means bad. The problem lies in what I strive for. 

There are a lot of attractive goals being advertised in our culture - being rich, being famou

Just like in art, my goals should be formed more as a reaction to the state of the world around and inside me. There is no ultimate goal, and sometimes a goal can change to absolute opposite. 

What's important is to constantly check what dreams I'm following and if they're in line with my actual need.
