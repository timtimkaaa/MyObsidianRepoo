\[aw-then-tis-i-tee] IPA - noun
\- the quality of being authentic; genuineness;
\- the quality of being real or true.

When art is authentic - it means not pretentious, real, genuine. And it's considered one of the most important good qualities of art. In context of art authentic = good. 

Why is that?

1) The artist did it genuinely, so they aren't trying to fool and scam me. And I definitely don't want to be fooled, because that would mean loss of respect, shame.
2) The artist conveyed something intimate. And some people say that the more intimate, the more universal things are. At the very core all people are same
