I've spent quite s long time treating consciousness as an rudimental thing. But I was forgetting a very important thing: **it also helps me be a better person**.

Literally every time I changed for the better, I did so thanks to my consciousness. Every idea that comes to me, does so through consciousness. 

It's a crucial part of me, of being mentally healthy.
