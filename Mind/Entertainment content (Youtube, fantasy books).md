At this point of my life (19yo / Summer 2025) I have a media content addiction. So as a part of fighting against it, I want to figure out, what this content is, and in what way it's important to me.

<h3>Content is an escape</h3>
It's an ESCAPE from real life problems, a way to procrastinate and DISTRACT yourself from them by immersing into someone else's life. And that life is never realistic, bc/ that would not be entertaining otherwise. It's only the highlights of someone's life. Be that a movie character, a fun short video essay on people reading books in public or a blog. 

Pro's
- The obvious pro is that *it makes me feel good*. And obviously that's important too.
- It's an easy way out for when I'm not particularly satisfied with my life.
Cons
- My life is precious enough to not escape from. Yes it is hard, but also it's fun, exciting, nostalgic, fascinating and literally any other emotion possible.
- Whatever way I look at it, I know that no matter how good of a life I can live through a character in a show or a video game, it will feel less real than real life.
<h3>Content is a sedative</h3>
This is more of a subtle, subconscious way to look at it, but it is an ultimate way to not feel bad. Which is different from feeling good. They way it works is: feeling GOOD requires some action, while consuming content requires none and is still GOOD ENOUGH to not care about anything else and not seek out something more interesting.

Pro's
- It's a way to alleviate anxiety and problems. Although it only works while being on, so not a permanent solution.
- It's the easiest solution to not feeling good enough. And before I can even think of a better one, I automatically opt for this. And while at it I'm SEDATED, so I don't seek out any real ways to solve the problem.
Cons
- It's very ADDICTIVE, because it's such an easy solution. Pretty much like smoking.
- It's always a spiral, because I'm too sedated to even analyze, what brought me to it.
- Since I use it a band-aid for bad feelings, it's hard to stop, because then they come back.

<h3>Content is art</h3>
This is of course my favorite excuse. **What I'm consuming is art**. And I love art. Healthily and with my whole heart. **This is the reason I didn't just cut it off completely**. Because I would also cut off all of art. 

Pro's
- Art is my life.
- It's my favorite way of communication and discovering the world.
- It's fun. And the kind of fun that leaves you fulfilled, not empty.
- It makes me excited. Even while writing this I felt excitement in my throat.
- It makes me an interesting person.
-  Consuming art = learning and getting better at it... So by proxy art:
	- It's important to the WORLD. It's literally my best chance at influencing the world for the better with my morals and ideals intact.
	- it's important to ME as a way to explore myself.
	- It's important to PEOPLE with a face (who I know), like friends, family, consumers, who make themselves known and tell me how I helped them.

Cons:
- Consuming takes time from creating.
- It makes my voice more faint and replaces it with references.
- It makes me compare myself to every person I see. And they're inherently better than me - they have to be professionals for me to notice them. Or at the very least they post their works - which is more than what I do.
	- It makes me feel less motivated to do art
	- It makes me underestimate myself
	- It makes me more frustrated
	- In total: it makes me feel worse and discourages me from doing art.
- It's more entertaining that creating art, so I want to create less. And it still counts as an "artistic activity".


<h3>Content is relevant</h3>

Content is a way to learn more about the things that are happening in the world. Memes, news, videos casually mentioning the events - they all let me know what's going on in the world and make me understand the jokes and worries of people around me. I am more relevant consuming content.

Pro's
- It makes me more like others
	- I understand people around me. I get what they're talking about, their jokes and worries. But can't I get all that through just talking to my friends. Wouldn't that be another topic to talk about, another reason to meet and another way they help me, thus strengthening our bond?
	- People understand me. I'm speaking in relevant language.
	- I seem more like them. Internet slang and memes help me get into their "people-who-just-get-it" group immediately. 
- In a more artistic point of view, it's a portal into the mind of the society as a whole. The fact that I see a fun meme means it got popular enough to get to me, which means A LOT of people found it relatable. It's a kind of art really. The new form of interactive art that is being formed and molded by society as an entity.
Cons
- It feeds me relevant agenda and does so in a way in which I can't even doubt it.
- It makes me more like others. I have more to agree on, but less to offer. I and my ideas are less unique, more standardized, because I am being taught to think in some way propagated by media, and everyone else is taught the very same way. 
- Media is a bubble. and I can't see the whole picture with it. It's only the stuff the algorithm shows me. It's an illusion of choice, where I choose what to watch, but only out of the options the algorithm provides me with.
