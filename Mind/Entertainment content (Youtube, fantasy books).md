At this point of my life (19yo / Summer 2025) I have a media content addiction. So as a part of fighting against it, I want to figure out, what this content is, and in what way it's important to me.

<h3>Content is an escape</h3>
It's an ESCAPE from real life problems, a way to procrastinate and DISTRACT yourself from them by immersing into someone else's life. And that life is never realistic, bc/ that would not be entertaining otherwise. It's only the highlights of someone's life. Be that a movie character, a fun short video essay on people reading books in public or a blog. 

Pro's
- The obvious pro is that *it makes me feel good*. And obviously that's important too.
- It's an easy way out for when I'm not particularly satisfied with my life.
Cons
- My life is precious enough to not escape from. Yes it is hard, but also it's fun, exciting, nostalgic, fascinating and literally any other emotion possible.
- Whatever way I look at it, I know that no matter how good of a life I can live through a character in a show or a video game, it will feel less real than real life.
<h3>Content is a sedative</h3>
This is more of a subtle, subconscious way to look at it, but it is an ultimate way to not feel bad. Which is different from feeling good. They way it works is: feeling GOOD requires some action, while consuming content requires none and is still GOOD ENOUGH to not care about anything else and not seek out something more interesting.

Pro's
- It's a way to alleviate anxiety and problems. Although it only works while being on, so not a permanent solution.
- It's the easiest solution to not feeling good enough. And before I can even think of a better one, I automatically opt for this. And while at it I'm SEDATED, so I don't seek out any real ways to solve the problem.
Cons
- It's very ADDICTIVE, because it's such an easy solution. Pretty much like smoking.
- It's always a spiral, because I'm too sedated to even analyze, what brought me to it.
- Since I use it a band-aid for bad feelings, it's hard to stop, because then they come back.

<h3>Content is art</h3>
This is of course my favorite excuse. **What I'm consuming is art**. And I love art. Healthily and with my whole heart. **This is the reason I didn't just cut it off completely**. Because I would also cut off all of art. 

Pro's
- Art is my life.
- It's my favorite way of communication and discovering the world.
- It's fun. And the kind of fun that leaves you fulfilled, not empty.
- It makes me exited. Even while writing this I felt excitement in my throat.
- It makes me an interesting person.
-  Consuming art = learning and getting better at it... So by proxy art:
	- It's important to the WORLD. It's literally my best chance at influencing the world for the better with my morals and ideals intact.
	- it's important to ME as a way to explore myself.
	- It's important to PEOPLE with a face (who I know), like friends, family, consumers, who make themselves known and tell me how I helped them.

Cons:
- Consuming takes time from creating.
- It makes my voice more faint and replaces it with references.
- It makes me compare myself to every person I see. And they're inherently better than me - they have to be professionals for me to notice them. Or at the very least they post their works - which is more than what I do.
	- It makes me feel less motivated to do art
	- It makes me underestimate myself
	- It makes me more frustrated
	- In total: it makes me feel worse and discourages me from doing art.
- It's more entertaining that creating art, so I want to create less. And it still counts as an "artistic activity".
