Life has a lot of good and bad moments.  [[NEW There's always a reason to be happy, because there's always a reason not to be|It's crucial to look at the good stuff]] to live a happy life. And unfortunately human's subconscious is trained by evolution to focus on negative things to fix them and survive. While positive things are taken for granted. **What allows you to override these settings - is your consciousness.** 

It is the real driver of happiness. It's the reason we care about it in the first place. An unconscious animal doesn't care if it's happy ([[Happiness vs. joy]]), it only follows the traces of joy to do anything. While we are able to choose a better option, even if it's not intuitive and isn't as fun.

So the lesson here is: **Love your consciousness!** Sure it can cause some trouble, but it lets you fix it and many other things in life.
