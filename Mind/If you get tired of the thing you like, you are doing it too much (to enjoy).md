As it is right now, I've noticed a habit I have - I like to go back to productive things only after I get tired of entertainment and my brain really wants to work. And as the title says, this is not the best idea.

I think that [[Happiness is a finite resource|happiness is a finite resource]]. And thus the more you mine joy from some activity the less fun it gets and, more importantly, **the more you depreciate it** (value it less). 

If you don't want to stop caring for thing you care for, you should do them sparingly. That's the way to keep loving them.
