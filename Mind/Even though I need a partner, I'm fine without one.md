Lately I've been thinking a lot about how I need to find a girlfriend and restlessly searching for ways to do it. 

But the thing I'm forgetting is that I'm still living a good life without a partner. Sure, it's important for me to find one and it would be a great life improvement. But it doesn't mean that my life is bad right now. 

I shouldn't forget that ~={yellow}there's a milion ways to improve my life=~, but that ~={yellow}doesn't mean=~ that I'm living a ~={yellow}bad life right now=~.
