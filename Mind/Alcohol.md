Return: [[Mind core]]

<p>Being 19yo in summer 2025 I feel like I'm starting to really enjoy alcohol. I wouldn't say I'm worried about getting addicted to it. I don't like it that much. But I do feel like I'm using it without giving too much thought to it, and I think that's a little irresponsible.</p> 
<p>So I want to write out all the things that alcohol makes me feel and all the problems it solves, so that I know how I can achieve goals in question without alcohol. Or if there are issues for which alcohol is the best solution (I don't think there are), I will know when I really should resort to it.</p>

<h3>Alcohol is a mediator</h3>

When I drink I'm more inclined to talk to people, feel more open in communication and overthink less.

Pro's
- I talk to people more. Considering I have already come to the party which is half of the work.
- I get closer with people quicker. It's easier to talk about intimate stuff when you're drunk.
- I'm less careful and more fun.
- I don't overthink conversations, so it's easier to become friends with someone.
- Alcohol equalizes people: no matter who we are, where we came from - we're both drunk and thus careless. We can talk about anything without regret
	- I can meet important people this way and build a bond with them before they even realize it.
	- I can discuss sensitive topics with people who won't do it otherwise. When you're drunk you don't (need to) care about upholding your image/manhood.

Cons
- It causes me to do less thought out decisions:  
	- I can accidentally make someone feel bad.
	- I can scare someone away before we form a bond that would make them stay.
	- I can say stuff I don't mean and ruin a relationship.
