**I ii iii IV V vi vii°**  

Any chord is just a stack of 3rd's 
	==Major== triad = ==M3rd== + ==m3rd==
	==Minor== triad =  ==m3rd== + ==M3rd==
	==Aug== triad = ==M3rd== + ==M3rd== = ==M3rd== + (==m3rd== **+** ==1/2tone==)
	==Dim== triad = ==m3rd== + ==m3rd== = ==m3rd== + (==M3rd== **-** ==1/2tone==)


// Triad = I + III + V

### Seventh ###
 Imaj7 ii7 iii7 IVmaj7 V7 vi7 vii7♭5 

- Major triads like I and IV get ==maj7th== = *major seventh chords*
- Minor triads like ii, iii and vi get ==min7th== = *minor seventh chords*
- Major V triad gets a **==min7th==**  = *dominant seventh chord*
- Diminished vii° triad gets a ==min7th==, **not dim7th** =  *minor seven flat-five* or *half-diminished chord*

Any chord is just a stack of 3rd's

Any chord is **still** just a stack of 3rd's 
	==Major== seventh = ==M3rd== + ==m3rd== + ==M3rd== 
	==Minor== seventh = ==m3rd== + ==M3rd== + ==m3rd== 
	==Dominant== seventh = ==M3rd== + ==m3rd== + ==m3rd== 
	==Diminished== chord  = ==m3rd== + ==m3rd== + ==M3rd==
